Acknowledgments
This reference grammar quite literally would not have been written without the many Bardi people who spent so much time patiently teaching me about their language. †Nancy Isaac, Jessie Sampi and Bessie Ejai were the mainstays for this work. They (along with †Lena Stumpagee and †David Wiggan) provided almost all the data for the published Bardi dictionary, and worked tirelessly checking the supplement, prooﬁng the texts and cheerfully having weird sentences elicited from them for this grammar. They also looked after me in the community and, on top of that, were even happy to hang out and go ﬁshing. †Jimmy Ejai, †Katie W. Drysdale and †Maggie Davey also shared many things with me. I am very grateful to have had so many wonderful teachers. Thank you also to Biddy and Lorna for fun times in Derby.
Thanks also to the One Arm Point community and the Bardi Aborigines Association (and its Chairs and Administrators, most recently Rowena Mouda) for permission to work on the Bardi language. The Kimberley Language Resource Centre in Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing provided logistical support and administered my grants from AIATSIS from 1999–2003. The principals of One Arm Point school (Ron Pearson, Paul Bridge and especially Steve Price) also gave me a great place to work, which was much appreciated. Many thanks also to Sam Price, One Arm Point School culture program coordinator, for logistical help and good fun! The Isaac, Sampi, and Wiggan families were great to me and I’m really glad we can keep in touch. I’d also like to acknowledge the help of Jacquie Hunter, Janella Isaac, Maureen Davey, Rowena Mouda, Dwes Wiggan, Laurette Sampi, and Rodney Maher.
Another person without whom this book could not have been written is Gedda Aklif. She very generously provided me with all her ﬁeld notes, drafts, and dictionary elicitation tapes, which were invaluable and made my own ﬁeldwork much more focused. Her high standards of ethics in ﬁeldwork made my work at One Arm Point easier. I am very grateful to have had the chance to talk about many puzzling aspects of Bardi grammar with her.
I have discussed numerous aspects of this grammar with various people at various times over the last ten years. In particular I would like to thank Barry Alpher, Stephen Anderson, Avery Andrews, Gu¨ls¸at Aygen, Patience Epps, Mark Harvey, John Henderson, Luise Hercus, Joyce Hudson, Susumu

xxxiv Acknowledgments
Kuno, Linda Lanz, Joyce McDonough, Bill McGregor, Toby (C.D.) Metcalfe, David Nash, Conor Quinn, and Jane Simpson. Laura Kling has also been a big help in digitizing and processing Bardi materials; she also proof-read the manuscript. In 2011 I co-taught a class on Australian languages with Erich Round, which reﬁned my thinking of numerous aspects of Bardi; I thank Erich and the students in that class for many interesting discussions. I owe a special debt to the late Ken Hale, to my dissertation advisor, Jay Jasanoff, and to William Hawkins. I am grateful for the comments provided on the manuscript by Bernard Comrie, my editor for the Mouton Grammar Library.
My ﬁeldwork was funded from two grants from AIATSIS: G2001/6505 ‘Recording Bardi social history’ and G2003/6761 ‘Bardi grammar research’ and I gratefully acknowledge this assistance. Funding was also received from National Science Foundation grant BCS-0910936 which provided funds for ﬁeld trips in 2008 and 2011, for detailed analysis of the Laves materials. I also received assistance from the Endangered Language Fund in 2003 and 2011; the ﬁrst as part of working with the Laves materials; the second for checking oral historical recordings. Laura Kling’s ﬁeldwork was funded by Yale University’s Junior Research program, speciﬁcally the Kingsley Trust Association Summer Travel Fellowship, the Chase Coggins Memorial Fund Scholarship, and the Prusoff Memorial Fellowship (administered by Pierson College). This book was published with the assistance of the Frederick W. Hilles Publication Fund of Yale University.
This was not an easy grammar to write, though I suppose no grammar is. I have felt a very strong responsibility to Bardi elders to put as much as possible of the language on paper, to try and document even a small part of their knowledge. Yet it is very clear that doing so simply emphasizes what a sketch this book is, and represents just a shadow of the wonderful language Bardi was when it was in daily use. I make no claim that this is a ‘comprehensive’ grammar of the language.

Abbreviations and Conventions
Conventions
Ungrammatical forms are marked by *, and are in italics. Reconstructions are also marked with a *, but are not in italics. In glossing, a hyphen - marks a morpheme boundary, while = marks a clitic boundary (e.g. ginyinggon=min ‘then=CLITIC’). A plus sign (+) marks a bound stem. In Bardi, the set of bound stems comprise some preverbs and all inalienably possessed nouns. The citation form of preverbs given without their accompanying light verb is thus X+. The plus sign is used to indicate that the preverb is never used without the light verb and does not exist on its own (e.g. daag+ ‘sleep’). Inalienably possessed nouns cited in stem form without their preﬁx are cited in the unlenited form, with a + to indicate the position of the preﬁx, e.g. +ga ‘back, spine’ (cf. ni-ya ‘his back’). Clitics and afﬁxes are consistently marked, but bound stems are only marked where the stem status is relevant. Inﬂecting verb stems are marked with hyphens (e.g. -birril- ‘ﬂy’), as in previous publications on Bardi.

Some explanation is warranted here of decisions made in glossing. Explanations of Bardi morphology – particularly the verbal morphology – are given in overview form in Chapter 9. Bardi verb morphology is not always easily segmented, and it was difﬁcult to decide on the amount of information (and analysis-dependent information) which should be represented in the interlinearization. Should a verb like ingoorrooloonganirr ‘they collected them’ be segmented i-ng-oorr-oo-loonga-n=irr, which straightforwardly segments the surface form, or i-ng-arr-a-jooloonga-n=irr, which more transparently relates the individual morphemes to the morpheme-by-morpheme gloss and

provides more information about the presumed underlying form, but is harder to read? The latter makes it easier to ﬁnd out more information about the component morphemes, but also obscures the relationship between the interlinear glossing and the speech form. The former glossing conventions also presume certain theoretical choices (for example, in stating that the root is -loongaand not -ooloonga-, and that oo represents the augment transitive form). It is also somewhat artiﬁcial, since a form such as ingoorrooloonganirr is the product both of a series of historical sound changes which operated across morpheme boundaries, and historical and current morphological alternations.

(0.1) i- ng- oorr- oo- loonga -n

=irr

i- ng- arr- a- jooloonga -na

=irr

3 PST AUG TR collect REM.PST =3A.DO

‘They collected them.’

A further problem arises with forms such as inamana ‘(s)he put it’ vs inman ‘(s)he’s putting it’, and injalan, which means either ‘(s)he’s looking at it’ or ‘(s)he was looking at it’. In the ﬁrst case, it’s unlikely that the underlying form of the past tense is a; rather, the form is the result of cluster epenthesis and simpliﬁcation which has deleted the past tense morpheme ng. The same issue arises with pairs ingamarran ‘it was cooking’ (with nga- past tense) and inamarran ‘(s)he was cooking it’ (which shows the transitive marker and the a of the past tense). The past tense is therefore variably realized as ng, nga, ang, or a, depending on, in the end, transparent morpho-phonological alternations. This is also problematic because some of these alternations are lexically speciﬁed. Segmenting verbal morphemes is thus not straightforward.
An alternative would be not to segment preﬁx bundles at all, as in the following:

(0.2) ingoorroo- loonga -n

=irr

3.A.PST.TR- collect -REM.PST =3A.DO

However, this doesn’t solve the zero verb root problem or the preﬁx/root interactions, and overlooks the fact that there is a considerable degree of regularity in preﬁx marking. The solution adopted here is to provide a detailed explanation of the probable synchronic and historical processes which led to the current semi-regularities in the Bardi preﬁx structure, but to keep it distinct from the actual glossing. Therefore the glossing itself segments what is present in the surface form. Glosses are of the form given in (0.3) (and the ﬁrst line in (0.1)).

Abbreviations xliii
(0.3) Irrngankanjamb.
i- rr- nganka -n =jamb 3- AUG- talk -CONT =THUS
‘They’re [just] talking [to each other].’
The ﬁrst line just has the Bardi. The second has morpheme breaks, with no null morphemes except the verb root meaning ‘give’, which is always elided into adjacent morphological material. This root was historically *-wa-, but the w was lost through regular sound change and the a never surfaces independently of the afﬁxes which surround it. Lenited segments are represented as lenited (that is, in their surface forms), and elided segments are not restored. Epenthetic vowels are not segmented separately (that is, there are no segments glossed as epenthetic in the interlinear glossing); segmentation in the preﬁxes is therefore somewhat arbitrary. For example, there is no evidence for distinguishing a segmentation of the past tense and augment marker as ng-arr- as opposed to nga-rr; the former is used throughout for consistency.
Example referencing
There is considerable unpublished documentation for Bardi and referencing the collection is complex. Field notes exist in bound notebooks, unbound papers, and digital ﬁles (which themselves may be transcriptions of recordings or independent ﬁles) from multiple authors.
Examples in the text which are not labeled for language/dialect are from One Arm Point (Eastern (Modern)) Bardi. Examples from Laves’ texts (that is, from the 1920s) and from dialects other than One Arm Point Bardi are explicitly noted. Examples from unpublished texts are referenced by a code for the text name and the line number. A key to the texts and their speakers is given in Appendix D. References to Laves’ texts are of the form L100/12 (that is, L[aves], the text number, and the line number); the line numbers are editorial and refer to Bowern (in prep.b). Examples from written ﬁeldnotes are cited by the ﬁrst three letters of the collector’s surname, the book number and page number (BOW-FN3/4 [page 4 of Claire Bowern’s ﬁeld notebook number 3]; AKL-F3/6 [page 6 of Gedda Aklif’s book F3]). Full details of these references are available on request. References to items which were recorded digitally and transcribed directly into Elan are to the name of the digital audio ﬁle and speaker’s initials (e.g. BE: CB64.2). Unreferenced sentences are

xliv Abbreviations
from the Bardi dictionary, published as Aklif (1999) and subsequently much expanded. Sentences overheard or addressed to me in conversation, but not recorded, are marked ‘conversation’ with the year.
Bardi orthographies
The following table gives the orthographies in use by different authors working on the Bardi language. I follow the 1990 community orthography for this work (and all others) and for consistency I have standardized examples from earlier works to this orthography. Where the older spelling or non-phonemic orthographies from early sources (such Nekes and Worms (1953) and Laves (n.d.)) are crucial to the analysis, examples are written in this font. A consequence of using the community orthography throughout is that the presentation of phonology in Chapter 3 does not use IPA except for the phonetic description. Rules for alternations, for example, are presented using the standard orthography and this differs in potentially confusing ways from the IPA (for example, in the use of r for the glide [ô] and rr for the trill [r]). To present the grammar using IPA, however, would have raised yet another hurdle to Bardi community members’ access to the material. It would have shown disrespect, given that the orthography has been approved for use in works about Bardi. Note that the community orthography does not make an orthographic distinction between /u/ and /u:/. The short vowel is considerably more common than its long counterpart (no afﬁxes contain /u:/, for example) and the reader should assume that a vowel written as <oo> is short unless it is otherwise noted. Long vowels are marked here as o˙o to differentiate it from the short vowel.

Chapter 1 Introduction
1. Typological overview
1.1. Preliminaries
Bardi is the northernmost member of the Nyulnyulan family, one of the 27 non-Pama-Nyungan language families in Northern Australia and one of the ﬁve families of the Kimberley region of Australia’s Northwest. Despite work on the languages for more than 100 years, to date there exists no full published reference grammar of a Nyulnyulan language.
Languages in the Nyulnyulan family are structurally rather different from both the non-Pama-Nyungan languages which are more familiar in the literature, such as the Gunwinyguan languages (e.g. Evans 2003a), Bunuban languages (McGregor 1990, Rumsey 2000), and the Pama-Nyungan languages immediately adjacent (e.g. Sharp 2004). Unlike more familiar non-PamaNyungan languages, Nyulnyulan languages do not exhibit noun incorporation, nor do they have complex subject/object portmanteau preﬁxes; they have dependent marking and complex predicates with a syntax rather different from languages further east. Non-Pama-Nyungan languages share a few recurrent features, such as a pronominal plural marker -rr- and some independent pronominal forms (for which see Blake 1988, 1990, Harvey 2003), but very little else. In a survey of lexical and morphological features, Bowern (2004b) found no systematic similarities between Nyulnyulan languages and other non-Pama-Nyungan languages of the region, though there are a number of widespread lexical items which are probably the result of language contact.
Nyulnyulan languages have no noun classes or adjective-noun concord; they are one of the very few non-Pama-Nyungan languages with this feature.1 The verbal preﬁx morphology is also quite different. Nyulnyulan languages mark the subject (ergative or absolutive) as a preﬁx. When the subject is plural, tense appears between the subject preﬁx and the number marker. Direct and oblique object agreement is by enclitic. In Worrorran, however, and also in Gooniyandi and Bunuba, most agreement is by a combined subject/object complex in transitive verbs, which is reminiscent of an inverse system (Capell and Coate 1984, Rumsey 1982, 2000). There is a great deal of suppletion in

2 Introduction
the forms and subject and object are fused together in the preﬁx chunk. The ﬁnal major difference between the Nyulnyulan languages and the
other non-Pama-Nyungan languages of the area is the number of cases. Nyulnyulan languages have around 10 cases, expressing core grammatical functions such as ergative and dative, as well as locations and other relational meanings (privative and comitative, for example). Worrorran languages, in contrast, have a very limited set of cases. Love (2000:28-29) described Worrorra as having only four postpositions which also mark some case functions.2 Bardi is a typical Nyulnyulan language in this respect.

1.2. Inﬂectional type

Bardi is a highly inﬂectional language: partly fusional, partly polysynthetic, partly agglutinative. In the terminology of Nichols (1986), Bardi is a doublemarking language. Most phrase types are marked for information about both the head and the dependent. A summary is given in Table 1.1. Items in bold are marked morphologically in Bardi.

1.3. Topics of theoretical interest
Bardi has a number of rare features and interesting properties that deserve special mention. These features are summarized here, and references are given to more detailed discussion later in the grammar.
Bardi has a unique vowel inventory, with a mid-height back rounded vowel /o/ but no equivalent front mid vowel. The system is also asymmetrical, with more short vowels than long vowels (though that is not so unusual). More

Typological overview 3
information is provided in §3.2. There are complex lenition patterns which cause alternations of many afﬁxes; these lenition rules are both speciﬁed at the level of the afﬁx and differ by speaker.
Bardi is a nonconﬁgurational language in the sense of Hale (1983). It exhibits extensive discourse-based omission of arguments, pronominal crossreference, some discontinuity and no evidence for a verb phrase. However, it also differs quite substantially from some other nonconﬁgurational languages; unlike Warlpiri, for example, there is no requirement for omitted arguments to be deﬁnite or recoverable information. Unlike Mohawk (Baker 1989), there is no requirement for interrogatives to be initial, there is quirky case marking, and Bardi has inﬁnitives (see further §15.1). We thus get a better sense of the variability in the syntax of such languages and the range of possibilities for pronominal arguments. Bardi apparently differs from its nearest neighbor Nyulnyul in this regard too; furthermore, evidence from the Laves materials from the 1928–29 indicates that Bardi has likely undergone some change in the last few generations to become more nonconﬁgurational and polysynthetic.
Bardi has complex predicates which consist of an inﬂecting light verb and uninﬂecting preverb.3 Complex predicates are an areal feature of Northern Australia (Bowern 2006a, McGregor 2002), but there are considerable syntactic and morphological differences between the languages which have been downplayed in the literature. Although the light verb inventory is comparable from language to language, the argument structure requirements for the light verbs differ from language to language, the syntax of preverb/light verb nexus and preverb inﬂection differ, as does the role of the complex predicate construction in relation to other types of verbal predicate. This is discussed in more detail in Bowern (2010b) and in Chapter 13.
There is a high degree of unproductive and semi-productive morphology. For example, of the derivational morphology discussed in §5.1, almost none is productive. It is tempting to relate this phenomenon to language death; after all, it is quite common for morphology to become less productive when languages cease to be spoken regularly. However, speakers have quite clear, consistent, and stable intuitions about the grammaticality of the relevant forms, which I would not expect if this were due purely to language death. Such judgments also contrast with areas of the language which have been subject to attrition, where judgments were not stable over the last ﬁve years. Furthermore, there is little indication that the situation was different in the Laves materials, which were transcribed from full speakers of the language who

4 Introduction
used the language daily. As a result of this level of exceptional, unproductive, and semi-productive morphology (particularly in the derivational categories), rather more space is spent on rule exceptions and in listing of individual instances than one might expect. The alternative would have been to present the rules which account for the majority of the data and ignore or gloss over the exceptions, but while that would have produced a more elegant (and considerably shorter) grammar, it would also have been a rather inaccurate description of the language.
Bardi makes extensive use of ‘second position’ at both the phrasal and the clausal level. Not only are there second position discourse clitics (§14.6, §16.2); case markers also occur in second position within the noun phrase (§5.2.1), no matter what the word class of their host. While case has properties of distribution similar to what we would expect to see with clitics, the case markers have the properties of inﬂectional afﬁxes.
2. Bardi dialects
The language was spoken at the tip of the Dampier peninsula, as far south as Pender Bay (Goorrbalgoon, Goorrwalgoon) on the western side of the Dampier Peninsula, and to Cunningham Point (Garramal) on the eastern side. Other names are Bard, Baardi, Bad or Ba¯d. People living at Lombadina call their language Bard or Baard, while those living at One Arm Point call it Bardi. Both names are used to refer to the language as a whole, and this creates a problem in choosing a single name for the language, since there are also some prescriptive views of language, and speakers tend to view other varieties as being ‘incorrect’ language. I use the name ‘Bardi’ as the cover term, as about 80% of my data come from speakers from the Eastern part of Bardi territory and Sunday Island, who call their language ‘Bardi’. I recognize that this will not be met with approval from Baard speakers, however, and I apologize for that. These names are long-standing and appear in the earliest records of the area. There were also names for surrounding languages.4
The dialect situation of Bardi has changed over the last hundred years. Modern Bardi is represented by a single dialect, and there is evidence for extensive convergence in the language of the last Jawi speakers towards Bardi. However, there is a great deal of historical information from various sources which gives us a better picture about the dialectal variation which may have been present in the nineteenth century. These dialectal boundaries are given

Bardi dialects 5
in Map 0.2 on page xxxvi. They are deﬁned mostly on phonological grounds, such as the presence or absence of ﬁnal vowels, and lenition patterns (discussed further below).
We can deﬁne three main dialects: ‘Bardi’ (the language of the eastern Dampier Peninsula and closest neighboring islands), ‘Bard’ or ‘Baard’ (the variety of the Western side of the Dampier Peninsula), and ‘Jawi’, which was the language of Sunday Island. There is also slight evidence for a variety of Pender Bay Bardi or Nyindinyindi in the southwesternmost part of Bardi country. There is some prescriptive feeling about the appropriateness of these names and their scope. For example, Baard people use the name Baard to apply to all mainland varieties, just as Bardi people (from the Eastern side of the Peninsula) use that term to refer to all varieties which are not Jawi.
Named varieties are all geographically located; we do not ﬁnd the clanbased or patrilectal system of language names that some other regions of Australia have. There is a coincidental correlation between booroo (patrilineal estate) areas and language varieties because all the patrilineal estates are contiguous and in well-deﬁned areas. The following sections describe the individual dialects in more detail.
2.1. Bardi
The dialect known as ‘Eastern Bardi’ or just ‘Bardi’ was spoken in the Ardiyol, Swan Point, Galan and Iinalabooloo regions (that is, the eastern part of the Dampier Peninsula and the close-in islands). This is the language recorded in Aklif (1999) as Ardiyooloon Bardi or One Arm Point Bardi. Most of the examples in this grammar come from this variety.
It is very difﬁcult to gauge precisely how many full and partial speakers of Bardi there are (for discussion of the reasons behind this problem, see Evans 2001). The numbers are, however, very small. Metcalfe (1975b:1) estimated there to be approximately 350 full speakers of Bardi in 1975. In 2001 I was able to ﬁnd no more than about 40, although my survey methods were hardly exhaustive. By 2010 there were fewer than 5 ﬂuent speakers and a number of others who have familiarity with the language but who cannot speak it ﬂuently.
Bardi people shifted completely to English in the 1950s, when the Sunday Island mission was closed and people were moved to Derby. However, the language had probably been in decline for some time. Whatever the exact

6 Introduction
numbers of ﬂuent speakers today, almost all the ﬂuent speakers of Bardi are in their 70s or older. Only the oldest Bardi people use the language daily. Many middle-aged people, however, can understand the language and some can speak it a little.
2.2. Bard or Baard
This is the variety spoken on the western side of the Dampier Peninsula in the Goorrbalgoon and Goowalgar areas; it is much less well attested than Eastern Bardi, although there is some work by Moya Smith (e.g. Paddy and Paddy 1988, Smith 1983, 1984-5, 1987) which provides lexical information and some syntax. Some of the Peile materials are probably representative of this dialect, since they were recorded from speakers living at Lombadina. It is also possible that some of the Laves materials recorded at Boolgin are in this dialect. However, because those materials seem to show Eastern features (such as ﬁnal vowel preservation), more likely they were recorded from Bardi (rather than Bard) speakers.
People say that the biggest difference between Bard and Bardi is the systematic deletion of ﬁnal vowels. There are also some lexical differences that separate Mainland varieties of Bardi, particularly in the area of ﬂora and fauna, but because I do not have much data for Bard, I cannot provide much information about other differences. Paddy and Paddy (1988) is a text in this variety and it does not appear to show differences in syntax from other Bardi varieties.
The material recorded in Nekes and Worms (1953) is probably also from this dialect, since there are lexical items in the source frequently cited without ﬁnal vowels and some words which are clearly borrowings from Nyulnyul. Bagar ‘bush turkey’, for example, is not found in Bardi country (and there is another word barrgara in the Laves texts which may refer to the same species). However, it is uncertain whether Nekes and Worms recorded a true version of Baard or whether their material also contains many lexical items cited from Nyulnyul.
2.3. Island Bardi
Island Bardi is a term used by people to refer to the variety of Bardi that was spoken on Sunday Island, as distinct from Jawi. Speakers of Island Bardi moved from the mainland to Sunday Island in the late nineteenth and early

Bardi dialects 7
twentieth centuries when the Sunday Island Mission was founded, and I assume that this variety dates from that time. The settlement followed an inﬂuenza epidemic in which many Jawi people died. By some counts, more than two thirds of Jawi people died in this epidemic, and Bardi people from the mainland largely replaced Jawi people as the main Indigenous people on the mission.5
Island Bardi is, as far as I can tell, identical to the variety of Bardi spoken on the Eastern side of the Dampier Peninsula. Metcalfe (1975a) recorded a term Injawardin ∼ Injawadin which was said to refer speciﬁcally to the island dialect of Bardi. This term was conﬁrmed by Nancy Isaac in 2001, but nothing further is known of its reference. I do not treat Island Bardi as distinct from Mainland Bardi here.
2.4. Jawi
Jawi or Jaawi is the traditional language of Sunday Island and the Buccaneer Archipelago. Other names and spellings in the literature include Chowie (= Jawi) and various forms of Iwanyoon, which means ‘from Sunday Island (Iwany).’6
There are a few people at One Arm Point who have speciﬁcally Jawi descent rather than Bardi, including the Tygan family, the Coomerang family, and some members of the Wiggan family. Most Jawi people died of disease when Sidney Hadley set up a pearling base and mission on Sunday Island around the turn of the 20th century. These days people see ‘Jawi’ as a family or cultural term rather than speciﬁcally a language or variety name. Apart from a few words which people recognize as ‘islander’ rather than ‘mainland’ (e.g. jigil ‘spear type’ and banyinbooroo ‘carpet snake’) there are today no clear features that distinguish the languages from each other. Laves, however, records them as separate dialects, and the Jawi of the Laves corpus is rather different from the Jawi used today. Bardi speakers describe traditional Jawi as being a bit ‘lighter’ than Bardi, and having a slightly different phrasing and use of deictic markers.7 Jawi data are seldom included here, except for where Jawi forms are known to differ from Bardi forms (see, for example, §9.4).
Data for Jawi were recorded by Laves in 1929, Anthony Peile in approximately 1967, and Howard Coate in the late 1950s or early 1960s. There is also a short description from 1910 (Bird 1910) and a word list from 1915 (Bird

8 Introduction
1915), but Bird’s materials are difﬁcult to use because of spelling. The Laves material comprises some short texts, part of the same corpus as the Bardi texts. A Jawi text is included in Appendix E. The Coate materials available to me comprise a recording of a story, along with a few wordlists.8 The Peile materials for Jawi are also wordlist elicitation, and some sentences.
2.5. Mayala
Another term used in relation to language and place is Mayala. Historical maps are vague about the ownership of the islands in this area. This is in part because of researchers’ concentration on certain mainland areas and islands close to the mainland, to the exclusion of the more remote islands; likewise Ngarinyin and Worrorra are much better documented languages than Umiida, Yawijibaya and Unggarranggu, the Worrorran languages which are spoken most closely to this part of the country.
In talking to Bardi people about this area, Mayala was sometimes called the same as Jawi, and sometimes different. In general, the term Mayala was used to refer to the geographical area of the islands off the coast of the mainland Dampier Peninsula. The term Jawi is primarily used to refer to the language. However, there is also evidence that the two are not synonymous; for example, there were Jawi booroo (patrilineal estates) on Sunday Island as well as Bardi ones, but there were (to my knowledge) no Mayala booroo on Sunday Island. The term Mayala appears in Aklif (1999). In this work, the deﬁnition is given as follows: “Islands off the coast of the mainland. All islands east of Iwany [Sunday Island].” That is, the work by Aklif conﬁrms that the term Mayala is primarily a term referring to place rather than language.
2.6. Nyindinyindi
In Anthony Peile’s collection of Western Kimberley recordings, there is a ﬁve minute sample of a language called Nyindinyindi, from the Pender Bay region in the far south of Bardi country adjacent to Nyulnyul. The name has no etymology and is not known these days. The language on the tape is clearly Bardi rather than Nyulnyul, and appear to be very similar to the Goolarrgoon Bardi or Bard varieties. The identity of the speaker and the date of recording are not known, though most of Peile’s recordings from this area date from the mid-1960s.

The Nyulnyulan family 9
3. The Nyulnyulan family
3.1. Composition of the family
Bardi is the northernmost member of the Nyulnyulan family. The Nyulnyulan languages fall clearly into two groups: the western group, to which Bardi belongs, along with Nyulnyul, Jawi, Nimanburru and Jabirr-Jabirr; and the eastern group, which contains Nyikina, Warrwa, Yawuru and Jukun. Ngumbarl is too poorly attested to be classiﬁed for certain but it probably also belonged to the eastern group (Bowern 2010b). A family tree is given in Figure 1.1.9 Many of these varieties are similar, but mutually unintelligible; the ‘Small’ and ‘Big’ dialects are mutually intelligible.
Most of the Nyulnyulan languages are now no longer spoken. Apart from Bardi, Nyikina and Yawuru are also still spoken by small numbers of people (my estimate based on my knowledge of the area is fewer than 10 speakers each). The last ﬂuent speaker of Nyulnyul died in 1999. The other languages became extinct over the period 1965–1995. There are, however, several thousand people who claim descent from one or other of the Nyulnyulan groups, and many of these people have some knowledge of a Nyulnyulan language, ranging from a few words to passive comprehension to some ability to speak.
The Nyulnyulan languages are not closely related to any other groups in Australia. The closest families geographically are Bunuban (a small family comprising just two languages: Bunuba and Gooniyandi), Worrorran, and the Marrngu and Ngumpin-Yapa subgroups of Pama-Nyungan. There have been, however, periods of extensive contact between Nyulnyulan languages and different non-Nyulnyulan languages: Yawuru and Karajarri (Marrngu, Pama-Nyungan) in the South, Nyikina and Walmajarri (Ngumpin-Yapa, Pama-Nyungan) in the East, and Bardi/Jawi and Yawijibaya (Worrorran) in the North. These languages not only belong to different families, but are also rather different typologically.
3.2. History of classiﬁcation
The Nyulnyulan family was identiﬁed by Schmidt (1919) as the ‘King’s Sound group’, which he classes as a member of the Western Subgroup (his term is Untergruppe), comprising the following:

The Nyulnyulan family 11
I. Ruby Creek Language10 II. King’s Sound Group [= Nyulnyulan] III. Ord River Group [= Jarrakan]
The Ord River Group is the Jarrakan family (also occasionally called Djerag), a non-Pama-Nyungan family spoken along the Ord River in the Eastern Kimberley. It appears that in the sample data quoted by Schmidt (1919:163) for these groups, the Ord River and the King Sound data are reversed. The forms given as ‘Ord River’ are clearly Nyulnyulan, although not deﬁnitely any particular Nyulnyulan language. They are probably Nyikina. The words given as samples for the ‘King Sound’ group are probably Kija, which is the westernmost member of the Jarrakan family. Some examples of as ‘Ord River’ are (along with their Nyulnyulan cognates and the words given for ‘King Sound’):
(1.1) a. Knochen (‘bone’) gand’e (cf. Bardi gaanyji); King Sound gud’i(l) (Kija kujim11)
b. Wasser (‘water’) wula (Bardi uula, Nyulnyul wula); King Sound koloe¨ (Kija kurlum)
c. Sonne (‘sun’) walga (probably Nyikina, cf. Bardi aalga and Nyulnyul walg); King Sound banda(l) (Kija parntel)
Capell (1940), in his classiﬁcation of Kimberley languages, also has a Dampierland group deﬁned typologically as preﬁxing languages without noun classiﬁcation. Capell’s is primarily a typological classiﬁcation, although he also took lexical data (and perhaps also kinship and other non-linguistic factors) into account. His group comprises the same languages as Schmidt.
O’Grady, Voegelin, and Voegelin (1966:35-36) state that there are four languages in the group: Nyulnyul, Yawuru, Nyikina, and Warrwa. Their survey was Australia-wide and was based on a wordlist of about 200 items. It was a lexicostatistical classiﬁcation with control for obvious loans. O’Grady, Voegelin, and Voegelin (1966) class Nyulnyulan as a family-level member of the Australian phylum.
McGregor and Stokes (2004) include ten distinct languages in their classiﬁcation, although they acknowledge that Bardi and Jawi, and some other pairs, are mutually intelligible. They also give information on the internal classiﬁcation of Nyulnyulan. My classiﬁcation differs in a few ways from theirs, particularly in the internal structure of Western Nyulnyulan. The main

12 Introduction
difference is the placement of Nimanburru, in the basis of data which was not available to Stokes and McGregor when the paper was written (for which see further §1.3.3). McGregor and Stokes’ criteria for subgrouping include shared vocabulary and shared morphology. They also presented lexicostatistical data.
Dixon (2002:667) describes Nyulnyulan as containing just two languages, Bardi and Nyikina, possibly following Hudson and McConvell (1984). This classiﬁcation, however, ignores both linguistic and socio-cultural facts. Socioculturally, it is incorrect to say that Yawuru is a dialect of Nyikina, since this implies that one variety name is superordinate to another. It is like saying that Swedish is a dialect of Norwegian. It is linguistically incorrect to say that Nyikina and Yawuru are mutually intelligible, since they are clearly immediately identiﬁable as distinct languages with several profound morphosyntactic and lexical differences. The inﬂuence of Karajarri on Yawuru, for example, makes it quite different lexically from other Nyulnyulan languages. Dixon (2002) also says that Nyulnyulan is possibly a dialect continuum of a single language, but he provides no evidence for this assumption. Bowern (2010a) shows that Nyulnyulan is not a dialect continuum.
3.3. Internal classiﬁcation
I largely follow McGregor and Stokes (2004) in their classiﬁcation of Nyulnyulan languages, although I differ on the placement of the languages that make up Western Nyulnyulan. I treat Nimanburru as a third branch, and not a dialect of Nyulnyul, based on its lack of shared innovations with Nyulnyul as in evidence from the Peile Nimanburru materials (Bowern 2010a). A family tree which shows the relations between the languages as I take them was given in Figure 1.1 above. I also treat Ngumbarl as a separate language from Jukun and Yawuru, based on the analysis of the Bates’ materials for this language described in Bowern (2010a).
McGregor and Stokes (2004) divide Nyulnyulan into an Eastern group and a Western one, and I follow this division here. I suspect that such a division is also implicit in Dixon (2002), with his Bardi and Nyikina ‘languages’ (one language from each group).12
There are some features that can be described as purely Eastern or Western. Lexical data are useful here, since many words can be reconstructed only to one subgroup or the other. Some examples are given in (1.2) and (1.3):

The Nyulnyulan family 13
(1.2) Reconstructible to Western Nyulnyulan only: a. *bardangka ‘tree’ b. *kajanunga ‘for a while’ c. *muunga ‘sugarbag’
(1.3) Reconstructible to Eastern Nyulnyulan only: a. *kurrbuk ‘vomit’ b. *makarra ‘tail’ c. *ngurrun ‘smoke’ d. *kulir ‘shoulder blade’
Another major difference between the Eastern and the Western languages lies in the organization of the verbal system. The Western languages are characterized by a four-way contrast in tense/mood in the verbal preﬁxes, as in (1.4) below (abstracting somewhat from allomorphic differences):
(1.4) a. present: -øb. past: -ng(a)c. future: -nggad. irrealis: -la-
This system is shared, with few differences, by Bardi, Nyulnyul, Nimanburru, and Jabirr-Jabirr. Another morphological peculiarity in only the Western languages is the allomorphy of the third person minimal subject marker, which depends on the tense of the verb root. In Bardi, the forms are i- for past and present and oo- (phonemic /u-/) for future and irrealis. Compare Bardi inanggamana ‘he put it’ (past) with oonkama ‘he will put it’ (future). (See page 72 for orthography conventions.) Other Western Nyulnyulan languages have cognate morphemes here.
The Eastern languages, however, have a much more heterogenous system, although they are united by a series of changes in which present -ø- and past -nga- verb preﬁx morphology collapse into a single ‘non-future’ tense (Bowern 2012). The Eastern languages have a distinct preﬁxal category of irrealis future (-ya-), which the Western languages lack. (In contrast, an irrealis future is marked in Bardi by the irrealis preﬁx -l- and the future sufﬁx -a.)

14 Introduction
3.4. External relations
While the unity of the Nyulnyulan family goes back to the earliest published classiﬁcations, including Schmidt (1919), no one to my knowledge has seriously proposed a close relationship between Nyulnyulan languages and any particular non-Pama-Nyungan language group. McGregor and Stokes (2004) make some suggestions based on running lexicostatistical results through cluster analysis software, but these do not suggest a close genetic relationship between Nyulnyulan and other Western Kimberley languages, only a ‘presumed genetic relationship’ (McGregor and Stokes 2004:caption to ﬁgure 3). Genetic relationships between all the languages of Northern Australia are presumed by Evans (2003d) and Heath (1990, 1997).
The subject of Bowern (2004b) was a search for possible external relationships between Nyulnyulan and the other major families of the Western Kimberley. I concluded that there was no evidence at this stage on which to posit a genetic relationship (in the traditional sense of the term) with any other Australian family. There are the usual collection of Wanderwo¨rter, general resemblances, and monosyllabic verb and pronominal forms which plague much remote genetic comparison in Australia.
3.5. Degree of difference between the languages
There has been some difference of opinion in the literature about how many languages make up the Nyulnyulan family. While McGregor and Stokes (2004) give 10 languages, Dixon (2002) states that there are only two, with the possibility that the whole family is a single dialect chain.
Information on mutual intelligibility is sparse, but we can rule out the theory that Nyulnyulan is a single dialect continuum. As I show in Bowern (2010a), the family does not have the appearance of a dialect chain; instead, there is clearly a split between two subgroups (Eastern and Western). Languages are not mutually intelligible between these two groups, though there is considerable common vocabulary.13 I do not have equivalent data for intelligibility between Bardi and Nyulnyul, but speakers clearly treated Nyulnyul as a distinct language. The treatment was not the same for Bard or Jawi, which were considered types of Bardi.
Bardi has undergone enough sound changes that words in this language can look rather different from their cognates in the other languages of the

Sources for Bardi 15
family (cf. olorrgi ‘seagull’, cognate with Nyulnyul walabarrki). Other differences are syntactic or lexical; some of these are also present between dialects. For example, the word aliji ‘in front’ can appear as a single word in Jawi, whereas in Bardi it appears only in the phrase aliji baybirr ‘one after another’.
4. Sources for Bardi
Bardi is the best described Nyulnyulan language (indeed, one of the best described languages of the region), although almost all the material is unpublished or in the form of ﬁeld notes. Materials date back to 1910, with Bird’s Notes on the Chowie Islanders (Bird 1910, 1915). Other publications followed. Gerhardt Laves collected very extensive notes on Bardi in the late 1920s, including about 100 texts in Bardi, and several in Jawi (Laves n.d.). Hermann Nekes and Ernst Worms published detailed notes on the Nyulnyulan languages in Nekes and Worms (1953).
Howard Coate worked on Bardi and neighboring Worrorran languages in the 1950s and 1960s.14 Toby (C.D.) Metcalfe published a study of Bardi verb morphology in 1975, and compiled a dictionary of over 3000 items (Metcalfe 1975a,b). The dictionary is unpublished, although many of the words appear in Bowern (2003b) and the manuscript materials are included in the current Bardi dictionary working database. Metcalfe worked mostly with men, including Tudor Ejai, Bessie Ejai’s husband.
Most recently, Gedda Aklif collected texts and lexical items between 1990 and 1993; an 1800-word dictionary was published as Aklif (1999), although other lexical items not included appear on the 50-odd tapes recorded as part of the dictionary elicitation project. A dictionary supplement appears as Bowern (2003b) and a new edition of the dictionary is currently in progress. Aklif’s texts were compiled, edited and put in book form for the One Arm Point school in Bowern (1999). Aklif’s ﬁeld notes are also extensive and were used in the compilation of this grammar.
The earliest sound recordings of Bardi are from 1911 (recorded on wax cylinders by Yngve Laurell; see Bostro¨m 2002 and Bowern 2003a). In addition to using previously collected materials, I made four ﬁeld trips to One Arm Point to work with Bardi speakers, totaling about nine months in the area, primarily recording oral history and eliciting grammar. Bowern (2003b) contains many of the words elicited through old recordings or which were

16 Introduction
produced spontaneously. About 40% of the texts I recorded have been transcribed and are published in Bowern (2002); others are transcribed but are unpublished, and some are yet to be transcribed. An edition of the Laves materials is in progress. There is further discussion of my ﬁeldwork and methods in §1.5.1 below.
Others who have collected Bardi materials are listed below. Full details can be found in Bowern 2007b.
• A short wordlist of dubious quality from Sunday Island was collected by Joseph Bradshaw and published in Mathew (1899).
• Arthur Capell made a set of several hundred vocabulary slips, including notes in shorthand. The cards from the ﬁrst half of the alphabet (A– G) are in the collection of language materials of Geoffrey O’Grady, while the second half is with Kenneth Hale’s personal papers at the MIT Archives. Capell also published materials on language classiﬁcation and general surveys from northwest Australia, including Capell (1940) and Capell and Elkin (1941).
• Anthony Peile made recordings of George Warrb discussing place names and bush medicine (Peile n.d.). He also recorded about eight hours of general material in several dialects of Bardi. The recordings date from 1966 or 1967. They were auditioned by Bardi speakers in 2008. They include place names, vocabulary elicitation, and some stories.
• Alice Moyle spent some time at Lombadina in June and July, 1968 and made extensive recordings of Bardi songs of all genres. These were played to Bardi speakers in 2003 and information on the songs was recorded.
• Geoffrey O’Grady recorded a tape of a Bardi speaker at Bidyadanga community in 1959; this tape includes elicitation with speakers of Karajarri and Yulparija. It also includes some sentence descriptions of the pictures in Steichen and Museum of Modern Art (New York, NY) (1955), a set of photographs of people from different cultures around the world.
• Wilf Douglas, a missionary on Sunday Island in the 1940s, made some Bible translations (now lost) and wrote and illustrated Douglas’ (1992)

Methodology 17
‘Word gems from Iwany’ (revised and updated by Gedda Aklif).
• Moya Smith, an archaeologist and anthropologist working on Bardi plant and site use, has recorded lexical items (Smith and Kalotas 1985) and some stories (for example, Paddy and Paddy 1988).
• Edith Nicolas completed a PhD (Nicolas 1998) on comparing Bardi and Bunuba verb morphology; she spent about 6 months on ﬁeldwork in 1996-97.
• Nekes and Worms (1953) mention other sources of missionary wordlists from Beagle Bay recorded between 1895 and 1910, by Droste and Emo. I have not been able to obtain copies of these materials, and do not know if they still exist.
I have also made reference to data from other Nyulnyulan languages, which come from both published and manuscript sources. The most important are Nekes and Worms (1953) (and McGregor’s (2006b) revised and annotated edition), McGregor (in press) for Nyulnyul, Stokes (1982a,b, 1985, 1999) for Nyikina, Hosokawa (1991) and Yawuru Language Team (1998) for Yawuru, and McGregor (1994b) for Warrwa.
Unless otherwise noted, the data for this study is Eastern Bardi; that is, it is data from speakers who belong to the Baarnarad and Iinalabooloo areas.
5. Methodology
All descriptions are shaped by the circumstances of data collection, by the interests of the speakers involved and of the linguist. I have been fortunate to have had access to a wide variety of sources for the language across the full-time period of its written attestation, and to have worked with intelligent, committed, dedicated, and ﬂexible speakers. But we must not overlook the fact that the precarious language situation itself has made it necessary to go hunting for diverse data sources. In this section I describe the corpus on which this description is based and point out some areas where the corpus composition has affected the description. I also outline some methodological and theoretical points of relevance to the grammar.
I view language as a systematic and arbitrary system which may be described internally and independently of the circumstances of its speakers.

18 Introduction
However, other factors shape the description of a language; social factors pervade language description—the circumstances of the documentation, the skills and interests of speakers and linguist (and the skills of the speakers in interpreting the linguist’s questions). We could argue that even elicitation prompts can have a social component within linguistics; consider, for example, the tendency to illustrate reﬂexive binding with sentences involving the phrase pictures of himself/herself.
5.1. Fieldwork
My ﬁeldwork included three ﬁeld trips while a graduate student (1999, 2001 and 2003) for general language documentation and work on my dissertation, and two subsequent trips in 2008 and 2011. The 2008 trip mostly included work on the Laves materials, while the 2011 trip focused on oral history transcription and residue queries from earlier work. The longest trip was 3.5 months, the shortest included 3 weeks at One Arm Point and a total of 7 in the Kimberley (including a stint as a volunteer at the KLRC working on a Nyikina learner’s guide). The total time spent in the ﬁeld was 11 months. I began as a temporary volunteer linguist at the Kimberley Language Resource Centre, working with Joyce Hudson and Tamsin Wagner on Bardi and Nyikina materials. My ﬁrst work with Bardi was editing Gedda Aklif’s texts for inclusion in a school reader.
While at One Arm Point, I stayed in vacant housing (a donga,15 the old police station, the old clinic, and the mechanics’ house, to be exact). Most of my ﬁeldwork was done through One Arm Point school, since language has long been considered something that the school should be highly involved in, and since I could then help with learner’s materials. The arrangement also provided a measure of formality to the arrangements which suited both me and speakers. From the beginning of my ﬁeldwork, my relationship with Bardi speakers has been primarily a ‘work’ relationship (although we are good friends), and it has had a degree of formality. That has no doubt affected (for both good and bad) the type of language materials I have gathered. There were clear expectations of me—that the language would be ‘good’ language, that I would make a record of the ‘best’ language, not casual speech, slang, or swearing. It has made grammatical elicitation easier, but has made conversational recording more difﬁcult. Therefore I would not call this method ‘ethnographic,’ and it was only in the last two ﬁeld trips that I was ﬂuent enough in

Methodology 19
Bardi to get much information on language use. I have included information on occasion about which speakers gave which judgments, especially where speakers appeared to differ. In doing so, I am not trying to imply that one speaker is right and another is wrong; rather, I assume that there are different ways of speaking Bardi (just as all other languages have differences). In other cases, I have made reference to the speaker because they ﬁgured out the basis for an analysis, or how to analyze a particular part of the grammar, and I acknowledge their work just as I would if a university colleague had done the same.
I have also done some informal observation, but since Bardi is almost never used in casual conversation the possibilities for this were limited. In the later ﬁeld trips I was able to converse in the language and I used this opportunity to test grammaticality of certain constructions. My consultants were also happy to correct errors in my Bardi and so a great deal of information was gleaned that way. Both Bardi and English were used as matrix languages for elicitation.
My work has been conducted with the permission of One Arm Point council. Not everyone in the community has been happy that a linguist has been working on their language, though as the number of speakers has dwindled there has been increased support for language materials and for a linguist working on the language. Some people were glad that someone was making a record of the old language and the old ways, but others felt that it was a bad idea to give that information to an outsider. The positive opinions were more common than the negative ones.
Copies of all notes and tapes have been provided to One Arm Point school’s language and culture program. All materials have also been archived at the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies in Canberra. Some of the narratives have been compiled into a separate CD and families of speakers have been provided with copies of these narratives.
5.2. Data sources and corpus coherence
The data for this grammar were collected from many different sources, both published and unpublished. The published material on the language is small compared to the wealth of ﬁeld notes and recordings in existence. Gerhardt Laves, Arthur Capell, A. P. Elkin, Alice Moyle, C. D. Metcalfe, Gedda Aklif, Moya Smith, Edith Nicolas and I have all done ﬁeldwork and compiled ﬁeld

20 Introduction
notes, in some cases over a number of years. These are discussed in §1.2 and §1.4 above.
Overall the sources show a fair degree of coherence. There are some lexical differences between the Nekes and Worms materials and mine, and some transcription differences among the sources which are probably due to researcher error. The biggest syntactic and morphological differences are between the Laves materials and everything else, and between my most recent ﬁeld trips (in 2008 and 2011) and earlier trips. In that last trip a number of constructions for which I had hoped to get more information seemed to have disappeared from the language. For example, the applicative constructions discussed in §12.4 had become unproductive and almost all my examples (gathered from speakers over 30 years) were considered ungrammatical.16 I take this to be symptomatic of language death. In previous trips it was noticeable that speakers’ morphological productivity increased as time went on in the trip. Some constructions were recorded only from Nancy Isaac before she passed away in 2004. I have tried to generalize across the Bardi corpus, and to note where constructions were particularly associated with one time period or source.
I have recorded over 100 hours of material on Bardi, comprising narratives, elicitation, and discussion of other materials (such as photos or music recordings) in roughly equal proportions. Aklif recorded about 70 hours, comprising about 20 hours of narratives and 50 hours of elicitation, particularly for examples for the Bardi dictionary (Aklif 1999). Amount of time with speakers varied by ﬁeld trip. In 2001, I worked 1.5-2 hours each with Jessie Sampi and Nancy Isaac each weekday morning, and then for about 1.5 hours with Bessie Ejai most afternoons. In 2003 I spent more time in joint sessions (for example with Bessie Ejai and Jimmy Ejai together). In 2008 most of the sessions with Jessie Sampi and Bessie Ejai were joint, and primarily involved working through the Laves materials (though I also did some syntactic elicitation with Jessie Sampi alone, and with Bessie Ejai). Not all of this material has been transcribed yet, although there is now a substantial written corpus, which forms the basis of the examples for the grammar.
I used many different methods of data collection in working on Bardi. These ranged from word-by-word translation to free conversation, with many different types of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured tasks in between. These included oral history recordings, picture, video, and toy prompts (to elicit deixis), and on occasion direct questions about the semantics of words in the language. The Bardi people I have worked with (Jessie Sampi,

Methodology 21
Bessie Ejai, and Nancy Isaac in particular) are very experienced in working with linguists and have very good intuitions about their language, which they have shared. I was very fortunate to be able to work with them.
I have also used corpus searches of my collection of spontaneous speech. These include oral history, mythological and personal narratives, and example sentences provided for the Bardi dictionary. At the time of writing this corpus is estimated to be approximately 120,000 words. This corpus contains narratives recorded by me, the narratives recorded by Gedda Aklif between 1990 and 1993 (including mythological stories, Bible stories and religious texts, and some personal narratives), the non-secret texts recorded by C. D. Metcalfe (some of which were published in Hercus and Sutton 1986), and the non-restricted portions of the Laves corpus from the late 1920s. For cultural reasons, the corpus cannot be made freely available at present.
On occasions I refer to the Bardi dictionary as a source of word frequency counts. The dictionary is based on Aklif (1999) and Metcalfe (1975a); about 3200 of the words were initially recorded in those two sources. It also contains words from the Laves texts, words recorded in Nekes and Worms (1953) which were subsequently checked with speakers in 2001 and 2003, and other lexical items from my ﬁeld notes which were not recorded elsewhere. As of 2012, the dictionary contains just over 4350 headwords. The dictionary is available to Bardi community members as a working document and a Bardi– English and English–Bardi manuscript for publication is in preparation.
5.3. Approach to language description
There are several ways in which this description differs from those typically published for Australian languages. First is in the phonetic description: I have relied on rather more acoustic measurements than is typical for grammatical descriptions. Recordings from before 2003 were digitized at 44,100 Hz from analog sources (or in the case of the 2001 and 2003 trips, redigitized from minidisc recordings). Subsequent ﬁeld recordings were made using an Edirol R-01 compact ﬂash recorder and external stereo (lavalier) microphone. Recordings were analyzed using Praat (Boersma and Weenink 2010).
Second, this grammar was not written with basic linguistic theory in mind. On the contrary, while the description is couched in the functional typological vocabulary which is common to basic linguistic theory, the inspiration for much of the work has been theoretical questions in both lexical functional

22 Introduction
grammar and government and binding theory. I do not believe that letting the language ‘speak for itself’ is a meaningful way to describe structure; I am interested in what’s possible as well as what is actually said, and what Bardi can tell us about language more generally. Therefore while I hope that this work will be accessible to linguists of different formal and functional persuasions, I do not think of it as a primarily functional description. At times, I presume some familiarity with (or at least tolerance of) principles of argument structure which are common to all current formal theories, and without which it is impossible to provide principled arguments for how verbs and their arguments combine, and why certain combinations of nouns and verbs are ungrammatical.
As mentioned in Bowern (2005), much of the grammatical work for nonPama-Nyungan languages has focused on morphology and morphosyntax, at the expense of syntactic description. Although the morphology of languages like Bardi is complex and somewhat irregular, it is not at all the case that the morphology ‘does the work’ of the syntax in less morphologically complex languages. For example, although the constituent order is very free, it is not unconstrained. Discourse principles account for a great deal in the ordering, but they do not account for everything, and so a theory of constituency beyond major discourse functions is required to account for how Bardi sentences are formed grammatically.
In many places in this description, I have given an indication of the relative frequency of alternative constructions. I have not quantiﬁed most of these frequencies; rather, they are stated in terms of the relative commonness or rareness of the construction. Where more precise numbers are important, I have done text counts. Elsewhere, I have based the frequency judgments on corpus searches and perusal of the examples returned, and occasionally on my own impressions based on 10 years of working with this material.17
Bardi is not a typical Nyulnyulan language, and since information for other Nyulnyulan languages is rather more widely available (particularly those that McGregor has worked on; see for example McGregor 1990, 1994b, 1996a) I have tried to place this description in the context of the other languages in the Nyulnyulan family and in the region. One reason for doing this is that there is a tendency to view Australian languages as all rather similar. While there are similarities in phonemic systems, case marking, and other broad areas, this standardization of description has, I believe, led us to emphasize the similarities between the languages at the expense of their differences.

Methodology 23
My window to Bardi culture has been primarily through language. Through oral history and friendship I have been privileged to be offered a glimpse into other worlds: traditional Bardi culture and practices, and a way of living informed by the memories of those practices, which is different and all the more vibrant for it. (Some of this is captured in One Arm Point School 2010.) I have included some information about traditional practices in Chapter 2; these were things that the old people particularly wanted to document. Those practices come through in the examples, as do, I hope, some examples from daily life. While for the most part I have chosen examples which illustrate well the grammar under discussion, I have also tried to choose examples which might be helpful for Bardi people learning the language.
5.4. Information management
In doing ﬁeldwork, and in working with old materials, I have inevitably come across pieces of information which are restricted in various ways. Bardi speakers have told me personal narratives, and on occasions shared information which would be inappropriate to make the subject of a grammatical study. Some of this was simply personal; others involved topics—such as details of early massacres and child removal—which would be trivialized by treating them piecemeal as objects of grammatical dissection. Other information was restricted for cultural or ceremonial reasons. Authors in the early 20th Century (all community outsiders) did not show reticence in publishing gender-restricted material. I have not used examples from these materials in preparing this grammar.
I have never asked directly why senior Bardi people have wished to make a record of their language, but from indirect discussion I can draw some conclusions. Some elders have been worried that their language is not being passed on, and they wish a permanent record of the language and its words and structures. For others, the concern has been to treat the language as a vehicle for traditional knowledge. That is, they are less concerned to describe the language structures than to record traditional narratives and information about the country and Bardi society. A third reason has been language pedagogy— they were working with a linguist so that their children and grandchildren would be able to learn the language after they were gone.
Bardi people differ on their views of who should have have access to the materials and the traditional knowledge recorded by linguists. For the most

24 Introduction
part, the elders were very clear that they wanted non-restricted information about Bardi language and culture to be widely known. In short, they were sick of being marginalized in Kimberley and Australian history. They wanted it widely known that the Bardi language is complex and just as good a language as any other, that Bardi people have not been wiped out, and that their history is a valuable part of the Kimberley record. They also maintain a distinctly Bardi (or Baard) identity which is different from a more generalized ‘Indigenous’ or ‘Aboriginal’ identity. However, at various times during my time in working on Bardi there has been tension among One Arm Point community members about how much information about the language should be available to outsiders. Some have maintained that the language should be published, while others have felt that the language should be restricted to those with a heritage (or birth) right to it (which would not include me). Among ﬂuent speakers of the language and their immediate families, however, the consensus I have heard has always overwhelmingly been that keeping the language secret will not help preserve it.
5.5. Audience
This is an academic grammar aimed at linguists, so it uses the technical terms in linguistics and is set out in the way that linguists organize grammars. That, unfortunately, is not the best way for language learning. A learner’s guide was drafted in 2006 and has been circulated at One Arm Point (Bowern et al. 2010); it has undergone several revisions since then. That book sets out Bardi grammar and morphology and was written with language learners in mind. There is a much greater emphasis on common vocabulary and phrases and on explaining terminology in the learner’s guide. People who want more information about Bardi will still be able to make use of this reference grammar, however, especially if they concentrate on the examples and how they ﬁt together. There is a detailed set of references to morphology (word pieces) in the index.
5.6. Number of speakers and language vitality
Over the time I have been doing ﬁeldwork at One Arm Point, the number of speakers of Bardi has gone from over 40 to around 5. Over the life of

Methodology 25

the corpus (from the Bird materials in the late 19th Century), the community has gone from essentially monolingual and entirely Bardi-speaking to essentially monolingual in English, though with varying degrees of familiarity with Bardi. At the same time, however, the number of people identifying as Bardi is growing, and is larger now than it probably ever was. Figure 1.2 shows the number of speakers plotted against number of community members.
The number of speakers has implications for the description. While 30 people probably already sounds like an extremely small number of speakers for a language, it is enough for a small community of practice if they all talk to one another. The Bardi-speaking community has gone from a small number of people who saw each other daily and who used the language almost daily to an even smaller number of people who are somewhat isolated from one another, and who no longer use the language on a daily basis.
This attrition is reﬂected in some of my data. I did not ﬁnd many language death features in my data, except for the most recent ﬁeld trips in 2008 and 2011 (and further work conducted by Laura Kling in 2010). In earlier trips there were some indications that the language was not in frequent use: for example, speakers tended to use more complex morphology the further we were into the ﬁeld trip, as though there was a ‘warm-up’ phase of getting back into practice. The texts recorded by Gedda Aklif in 1990 contain considerably more clause linking, and tend to be longer.18 The data in the ﬁrst three trips were quite stable with a high degree of consistency between speakers and

26 Introduction
within speakers. This has had some consequences for the description. While earlier work focused on textual work, elicitation, and some grammaticality judgments, a fair amount of the more detailed work has of necessity been based on textual materials and the crucial questions which would clear up the grammar points weren’t able to be asked. I do not mean this as a criticism of speakers, and it should not be taken as such; it is a linguistic description of differences in forms of the language across the time I have been recording it. It is also an explanation of why there are forms in this grammar that Bardi people might not hear these days (and that speakers might not accept).
These days there is extensive codeswitching between English and Bardi in all spontaneous speech (although less in narratives) and controlling this is part of the grammar of contemporary Bardi (and perhaps one way in which modern Bardi is different from the Bardi of the Laves texts).

Chapter 2 Bardi Ethnography
Bardi people were traditionally hunter-gatherers and ﬁshers; in every way they were (and are still) sea people. They live along the coast of the Dampier Peninsula and surrounding islands. They got (and still do get) much of their food from the ocean (Smith 1983), and while some food, such as yams, came from inland, the focus of the culture is very much towards the ocean. In this they reﬂect a more general Kimberley Aboriginal division between Land people and Sea people. The tip of the Dampier Peninsula is semi-tropical. The region has monsoonal weather, with a warm dry season lasting from March to October and a hot humid ‘rainy’ season lasting from November to late February.
I present here a description of traditional Bardi life; I include it as a compilation of information from various sources that might be of interest both to Bardi people now and to others. I am deliberately not describing Bardi people’s current lives. I was a guest in the community to do language work, not to make observations about current life; the traditional ways were of interest to the people I was working with and they wished to talk about them and record them. In doing so I neither imply that Bardi people live like this these days nor wish to imply that they are tied to a culture from another time.
In talking about the ‘old days,’ the senior Bardi people had many different reactions. On the one hand, they recognized the toughness and uncertainty of their lives then (and some noted that life is still uncertain, but in rather different ways these days). On the other hand, there was also a good deal of nostalgia for some aspects of that life, particularly the freedom to move about own’s own land, the community cohesion and sharing, and the lack of problems associated with alcohol. There was also some pride in the ability to live in that country despite the harshness of the life, and considerable pride in the detail of traditional knowledge about the country that came with living through the land.

28 Bardi Ethnography
1. Precontact population size
The population of the region in pre-European times is difﬁcult to know, as there have been no publicly available archeological surveys of the region.19 At the time of the founding of the mission on Sunday Island at the end of the Nineteenth Century, there were perhaps 150 Bardi and Jawi people living on the island. There is evidence, however, of an inﬂuenza (or perhaps diphtheria) epidemic which preceded Europeans into the Kimberley in the 1870s (Crawford 2001). All in all there might have been perhaps 1500 or more Bardi, Baard, Jawi, and Mayala people across the region in the period immediately prior to European settlement. This calculation is from patrilineal estate estimates and assumes an average of between 40 and 50 people per booroo (patrilineal estate). This is reasonable assuming that the population estimate of 150 is correct for Bardi/Jawi people on Sunday Island before European settlement. Estate sizes vary quite substantially, however, so this ﬁgure should be considered approximate (Gibson 1951, Robinson 1973).
2. Ecology of the Dampier Peninsula
2.1. Seasons
The Bardi year is divided into six seasons. They are deﬁned based on several factors, including what fruits are ripe, which ﬁsh are fat, when turtles are mating, and the direction of the prevailing winds and strength of the tides. The seasons do not have absolutely deﬁned dates and can be longer or shorter depending on the year; the seasons themselves are of unequal lengths and range from several weeks to several months. The word lalin is also used to translate ‘season’ and ‘year’. The following descriptions of the seasons are reproduced with minor edits from Aklif (1999).
2.1.1. Mankal
Mankal is the wet rainy monsoon season. There are strong winds and storms (oonkoonkool) from the ocean as well as whirlwinds (ajibankoor). There is little fruit available. It’s the end of the turtle hunting season, but this is a good time for collecting turtle eggs. Some years mankal only lasts for one or two weeks in January or early February, though in other years it is longer.

Ecology of the Dampier Peninsula 29
2.1.2. Ngaladany
This is the end of the wet season. It’s very hot and very humid. There is no wind, and people don’t move around much. It’s not a good time for fruit. It’s usually in late February to early March.
2.1.3. Irralboo
This season has big tides. The low tides are good for reeﬁng. It’s a good time for fruit. At the beginning of the irralboo season the weather is hot, and sometimes soft rain falls. Later south east breezes (alboolboorr) begin to blow. This is the mosquito season (which affects which campsites people would use). The peak of irralboo is usually in April and May.
2.1.4. Barrgan
Barrgan is the cold season and there are strong south east winds. At this time many ﬁsh are fat, but the tides are not good for reeﬁng. People used to ﬁsh at night (oondoog). It is also the dugong (odorr) hunting season, and it’s a good time for bushfood. Pandanus nuts (gaamba) are red and joongoon fruit is ripe. Barrgan lasts from May to August.
2.1.5. Jalalay
West winds (almbana) begin to blow in this season, which comes in September and October. The dugong hunting season ends. People go out reeﬁng in the low spring tides. Stingray (barnamb(oo)) are fat at this time.
2.1.6. Lalin
Lalin is the turtle hunting season and usually starts in about November. People call it ‘married turtle season’ because it is the mating season for turtles. This time is good for iilarra ‘wild apple’ (Syzgium suborbiculare) fruit. It gets hot and humid during the build up to the wet season. Winds shift from westerly to strong north westerly (banijoon). Tropical storms (janjal) come from the north west at the end of the lalin season, and bring rain. It lasts until the wet season or mankal begins again, usually in January.

2.2. Tides

Everyone in Bardi society (not just navigators or hunters) had a detailed knowledge of the tides and tidal currents. Tides are very strong in this part of the world, with a ten meter difference between low and high tide during spring tides. The water runs strongly through narrow channels and off the reefs, creating whirlpools and horizontal waterfalls. Directions are still given ‘with the tide’ (joodarrarr) or ‘against the tide’ (arrinarr) by old Bardi people.
Different tides are named, based on their strength, their direction, and the time of day. The recorded names are given in Table 2.1. Molangan ‘ﬂood tide’ and mayoordin ‘ebb tide’ are general terms for tide directions. The others are speciﬁc. The way to ask about what the tide is doing is to ask anggi gaarra, literally ‘what tide, what sea.’

I have no information on astronomical knowledge. Some constellations are named, including birriny ‘seven sisters’ (Pleiades). Bardi people did not travel at night by choice, given the hazards of sharks, snakes, crocodiles, and tidal currents, though they could do so when necessary. Therefore they did not use techniques of celestial navigation. Rouja (1998) contains substantial information on marine resource use.

Flora and fauna 31

3. Flora and fauna

Bardi people had a comprehensive knowledge of the plants and animals in their country and its seas. Flora and fauna in Bardi are named in a hierarchical system. There are three levels clear in the system. Not all animals and plants are uniquely categorized and there is some polysemy in naming. That is, there are terms which are both life-form (in the sense of Berlin 1992) and generic names. There is no single word for all living things (that is, there is no unique originator), though this is a covert category, since there is a distinction between living things (which are referred to as noonyji ‘alive’) and non-living.

Most terms occur at the generic or species level. Many species have a single term (that is, the folk classiﬁcation system corresponds to the species level of Linnean classiﬁcation), although some species have more than one term and are differentiated by gender, ripeness, or age. This is particularly true of commonly eaten ﬁsh species such as trevally. People know they are the same species and that the words refer to different life stages.20 In other cases, there is a single term which covers multiple species. All little birds are called by one of two terms (diindiin or alingindir), depending on whether they are colorful or not. There are generic terms which group the species terms into classes. Table 2.2 gives these terms. There are some other generic terms in addition to those given in Table 2.2; for example, goomboo is the

32 Bardi Ethnography
term for any large ﬁsh. It is thus more speciﬁc than ﬁsh in general but more general than a particular species.
Some of these terms may also be compounded. Aarli-mayi, for example, is the term for ‘food’; it is a compound of aarli ‘meat’ mayi ‘plant food’21). They may also be modiﬁed to give more speciﬁc reference (for example, gaarrayoon jo˙orroo ‘sea-ORIG jo˙orroo’ is the word for ‘shark’). The default reference for the word joorroo is snake. Goorlil is normally used primarily as the generic for turtle, but in older usage it also referred to dugong (odorr). Goorlil is further polysemous in that as well as the generic for turtles, it can refer speciﬁcally to the green sea turtle Chelonia mydas.
Some animals and birds had both an everyday common name and a special, sacred name for use in ceremonies. The ceremonial names are restricted information (Jimmy Ejai pers. comm. 2003) and are therefore not recorded here.
At the species level, some terms are polysemous between plants and animals. The term iilarra, for example, means both ‘wild apple’ (Syzgium suborbiculare) and its fruit, and is also a term for ﬂowery cod (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus). In other cases, one term has recently fallen out of use. In the Bardi materials from the 1930s, for example, gamaranginy ‘echidna’ was also recorded in the meaning ‘toad ﬁsh’, but this polysemy was not recognized by current speakers.
Information is conﬂicting about whether Bardi people had animal totems. There are hints in the earliest anthropological sources (for example, the ﬁeld notebooks of A. P. Elkin) from the 1920s that personal totems were used and were instantiated by (among other things) food taboos. None of the people I spoke to were familiar with personal totems or food taboos as a Bardi practice, however.
4. Food and medicine
4.1. Food sources and hunting practices
Information about traditional food consumption comes from current practices of the oldest Bardi people, their memories of growing up, and accounts from the older literature (in particular Smith and Kalotas 1985).
Most traditional food came from the sea: shellﬁsh, ﬁsh caught with spears or poison, larger marine animals such as dugong and turtle, and stingrays.

Food and medicine 33
Land animals were also hunted, including kangaroo species, goannas and other reptiles, and insects. Whales and sharks were not eaten (there is a cultural taboo against eating them).
Seed grinding and winnowing was not used in this area (Smith 1983). Staple foods include ﬁsh, shellﬁsh, and small game. There are also several species of yam growing in the region, including Dioscorea and Glycine species. Pandanus nuts were eaten but cycads were not.22 There is also extensive bush food from plants and trees in the country; this is detailed in Smith and Kalotas (1985) and Paddy, Paddy, and Smith (1987).
There is no permanent surface water in Bardi country. Rivers ﬂow only after heavy rain and the word iidarr ‘creek’ refers to a tidal salt water creek (that is, the temporary tidal creeks that ﬁll up behind sand banks on beaches). Drinking, cooking, and washing water comes from underground springs or soakages (and these days from bore water). Finding the soakages required local knowledge. There are stories of strangers to the country trying to ﬁnd water but being unable to do so. Either the water disappears, or the strangers are oblivious to its presence. Strangers must be introduced to the country in order to make use of this resource.
Turtles, dugong, and sometimes stingray were hunted from a mangrove raft. While the hunting was done by men, looking out for turtle was a family activity. Fishing with spears was also done by men; the women used ﬁsh poison to stun the ﬁsh and make them ﬂoat to the surface for easy collection. There are two types of ﬁsh poison; ilngam and banyjoordoo.23 The former was used on the islands, while the latter is from the mainland and comes from the Galan area primarily. One of the poisons is a mild alkaloid which is not harmful to humans. The other works by removing oxygen from the water so that the ﬁsh are stunned and ﬂoat to the surface.
In addition to ﬁsh poison, ﬁsh were speared. These methods are both still used, though ﬁshing from the shore with hand lines or trawling lines from a boat are now more common. Fishing lines and hooks were also sometimes used in traditional times, with the lines being made from ﬁg tree string.24 There were also permanent ﬁsh traps in several areas in Bardi country. Some were used for moonlight hunting, where the ﬁsh would come into the trap while the tide came in, and before the tide turned spinifex grass would be placed into the permanent stones of the trap. Everyone worked along the trap line with lighted spinifex torches to prevent the ﬁsh from escaping as the tide went out. The ﬁsh were then easily collected as the water level dropped.
Meat from sea and land creatures was cooked on the coals of a ﬁre or in

34 Bardi Ethnography
an earth oven (laalboo). Water was boiled in baler shells or in a turtle shell. Paperbark was used for plates.
Dugong and turtle are hunted by men only. Both were hunted from gaalwa or ‘double’ rafts made of mangrove logs (these days they are hunted from tinnies, or small aluminium dinghies). Dugong are drowned and turtle are caught by diving onto their backs and holding up the shell to prevent them from diving deep underwater. They are then towed to shore and placed on their backs until they are killed. There were, to my knowledge, no taboos on uttering the names of animals while they are hunted, though my information on traditional hunting practices is mostly secondhand. Likewise, there are no taboos on uttering the names of dangerous animals.
There is a speciﬁc order in which parts of turtle and dugong are cut up for cooking and sharing. Meat was (and still often is) shared between family groups, with particular relations to the catcher receiving certain parts. These are outlined in the dictionary. An example of the main parts of a dugong is given in Figure 2.1. The parts given to each relation vary from person to person and are chosen at the boy’s initiation (Gibson 1951:17).
Figure 2.1. Dugong parts
Shellﬁsh is plentiful in Bardi country and is used not only for bait but also for eating. Langar is the typical bait for some types of ﬁsh; there are also different types of oysters, and other shellﬁsh (which have the collective name barnangga).
Small land game was hunted with spears and boomerangs. There are kangaroos in the general area, and also goanna and blue-tongued lizard. It is unclear whether snakes were traditionally eaten.

Material culture 35
4.2. Cooking procedures
There are several different ways of cooking food. Some items are boiled; no˙orrma (boiled and congealed turtle blood soup), for example, was boiled in the turtle’s shell. Water was boiled in baler shells (ambool).
Common ways of cooking meat and yams included roasting over hot coals and cooking in earth ovens. For the former, the ﬁre is allowed to die down and then the food items are placed in the ashes. Fish were cooked whole, without scaling (and sometimes without gutting), though they were also gutted. In the case of very fatty ﬁsh, the fat and ﬂesh would sometimes be mixed together and then returned to the ﬁsh for cooking. They were then placed on a paperbark plate for eating.
Earth ovens (laalboo) are made by digging a hole and lighting a fairly large ﬁre in the bottom of it. Once the ﬁre has died down, ﬂat rocks are placed on the coals. The best rocks for this purpose come from a place on Jayirri island, and are still brought to other places in Bardi country for that purpose. One the rocks are heated, the food is then placed on the rocks and covered in sand for a few hours until fully cooked. These days it is a good way to cook damper.
Bardi people did not practice seed grinding and so did not make breads or ﬂours in precolonial times.
5. Material culture
5.1. Transport
Bardi people were traditionally semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers and ﬁshers. That is, they did not practice agriculture or keep gardens, but nor were they opportunistic foragers. They had (and have) a well-deﬁned land tenure system, deﬁned camp-sites within patrilineal estates, and practiced some types of resource management (such as the use of ﬁsh-traps). While there were patriclan-based camping areas, groups of people would move from place to place at certain times of the year.25 For example, when the turtle hunting was good (at ‘married turtle’ or lalin time, towards the end of November), people would camp near the places where turtle could be seen from the headlands. Camping places are just about all within sight of the sea (or within a few kilometers of it). In stories from the 1920s, any time a character camps further

36 Bardi Ethnography
inland, the storyteller makes a comment about how unusual and remarkable this behavior is.
There were trails and accepted, customary ways of traveling between various campsites over land and sea. Using these routes required knowledge of the tides; knowing how to navigate the waterways was a necessary skill, and not just for hunters. For example, Bessie Ejai described how one must wait for slack tide (when the tide is turning) to cross certain channels; in other cases one can only go with the tide, and must get partway and then wait for the tide to turn so one can continue (e.g. from Niimidimanggoon onward to Sunday Island from the mainland). Currents in this area are often very dangerous and difﬁcult to navigate even with outboard motors these days.
Bardi material culture is probably fairly typical of sedentary or semisedentary hunter-gatherers, with the exception of the gaalwa, or double-raft. A gaalwa is a raft made of mangrove logs (from the species joolboo or kapok mangrove (Campostemon schultzii)). The logs are cut, then dried, at which point they become very buoyant. Then holes are made in the planks and wooden pegs are driven in to keep the logs together. The logs are also lashed together for added strength. This creates the jonyjol or lower part of the raft. The upper part is called the nirrongorrol and is lined with spinifex and used to keep things dry. The raft is paddled by a single paddle from the stern. Gaalwa were regularly used for hunting and transport of several people. Their manufacture and use is described in Rouja (1998) and an example made by senior Bardi men can be seen at the Maritime Museum in Sydney.
Bark canoes called barrawar were also known to Bardi people, and occasionally used, but the gaalwa was the preferred means of transport. Otherwise, people would move between places by swimming. Older stories have considerable information about the speciﬁc journeys and preferable routes.
5.2. Weapons
The toolkit of all groups in the area was multifunctional and fairly small. The word for a person’s ‘things’ is ooldoobal or oongganggoo.
The main weapons for hunting, ﬁshing, and ﬁghting were boomerangs (jiiwa, irrgili) and spears (jaala, jinal, irrol). Some spears were made from a single piece of wood, with the tip hardened in the ﬁre. Others (jinal) had a wooden shaft with a stone, glass or metal tip which was ﬁxed to the shaft with arrba (gum) or limirri (sugarbag wax or spinnifex gum). Stone was

Material culture 37

the traditional material for the tip, but glass or metal were used after Europeans arrived in the late Nineteenth Century. Tipped spears are felt to have been a foreign item; the Bardi traditionally used ﬁre-tipped spears and the stone-tipped ones were felt to be a fairly recent introduction. Bardi men used spearthrowers (yarnkal26 or ngabaliny). The word for a spear-tip is jimbila; this is a loan. Jinal is also likely to be loan from further east. Spear terminology is summarized in Table 2.3. Laves gives goorrjarda as a term for a spear with a long shaft, but this is an error; the term refers to a type of boomerang.

Boomerangs (irrgil(i) or jiiwa) were also made from several different trees, and are of several different types. The generic term is irrgil(i), which can also refer to the main tree (Hakea arborescens) from which boomerangs are made. Garrgarrbin are little boomerangs used by kids for playing, and for ﬁshing. Boomerangs can also be made from biindoon (red mangrove, Rhi-

38 Bardi Ethnography
zophora stylosa) for the ceremonial boomerangs used to accompany singing, or go˙olmi (Grewia breviﬂora). The ‘number seven’ boomerang27—ilbooriny or ilbirriny—also has a name, but it is said to be a loan from Nyulnyul. Laves records a term jaranggarr(a) for any type of large boomerang. Boomerangs can also be made from pindan wattle (Acacia tumida), in which case they are called wanggay, a loan from Nyulnyul. A returning boomerang is called yagarr or yagarr irrgili.28
Shields were made from several different kinds of wood, including jalgir (styptic tree, Canarium australianum) and raanyji (sandpaper ﬁg; Ficus opposita).
5.3. House-building
There are several different structures in which Bardi people used to live. Wind shelters or shades (known as baali) were constructed from pandanus or other palms. They are still used on the beach, principally for shade; they were a shelter from the sun or from rain in the wet seasons.
There were also other dwellings, including small grass-built sleeping huts. These were used primarily for sleeping and not for living in (most living was outside). Bardi people would also use rock shelters or gardin. This word translates as ‘cave’ but from the designation of what Bardi people have called by the English word ‘cave,’ it would be more accurately translated as a rock shelter; it refers to anything where the rock provides some shelter from wind, sun, or rain.
More recently, Bardi people live in European-style houses. There are two words for this: mayar and awij. The former is a widespread Kimberley word, while the latter is a loan from English. There are some rock-based houses on Jayirri island; their origin is uncertain.
5.4. Clothing and personal ornamentation
Traditional clothing was fairly minimal and included pearl-shell ornamentation and paperbark skirts for women. Personal ornamentation was also minimal. There was some ritual scarring (for both men and women) called bawoorr ‘cicatrice’, and some use of nose pins (arangay). Bardi people used to practice tooth avulsion, where the two incisors were removed. There is

Figure 2.2. Pearlshell and baali

Social organization 39

some documentation of ritual hair styles and headdresses in Elkin (1945), which involved clay. Joowalal was one hair style worn by men, where the hair was tied into a high bun using string made of hair. Some styles involved the use of moondoojirr ‘head sticks’. There was also use of body paint. Hair belts (baali29 or arnal) were also worn.
Bardi pearlshell ornaments were widely traded in the Kimberley and further aﬁeld. The ﬂat plates are called riiji in Bardi30 and the smaller side ornaments are called binyjibinyji. Uncarved pearlshells are called goowarn. For pearlshell trading, see further Akerman and Stanton (1994). A photo is given in Figure 2.2.
6. Social organization
6.1. Moieties and sections
6.1.1. Moieties
Bardi has two generational moieties: jarndoo and inar(a). These are egocentrically deﬁned; that is, a person is jarndoo and refers to all members of har-

40 Bardi Ethnography
monic generations as jarndoo.31 A ‘harmonic’ generation includes all member’s of ego’s generation (that is, for me, myself, my brothers and sisters, and my cousins and second cousins), and all members of ego’s grandparents’ and grandchildren’s generation. Inar or inara people are of the parents’ and children’s generations (and great-grandchildren’s and great-grandparents’ generations); these generations are called ‘disharmonic’ in the anthropological literature. Bardi people did not have other moiety divisions, such as are found in many other parts of the country.
6.1.2. Sections
Many Australian Aboriginal groups have a system of sections, a system of exhaustive classiﬁcation where each person is assigned to a group based on their parents’ section; sections also determine marriage eligibility (see further Dixon 1980, Walsh and Yallop 1993). Bardi people are notable in the Western Kimberley for being one of the few groups not to make use of section or subsection names. According to Capell and Elkin (1941), sections were spreading up the Dampier Peninsula in the early mission days and reached Nyulnyul (just to the south of Bardi country) in the 1920s and 1930s. The names of widespread Kimberley section terms such as banaga are known and recognized but are never used.
6.2. Kinship
Bardi is described by Elkin (1932) as having a kinship system of the ‘Aranda’ type. Aranda-type kinship systems are deﬁned by their having four distinct terms in the grandparents’ generation, in prohibiting cross-cousin marriage but permitting some second cousin marriages. This system is shared with Nyulnyul and Nyikina, with Yawuru having a ‘Karadjeri’ system.
Bardi kinship is classiﬁcatory, in that kinship terms may be used to address and refer to people beyond biological families. However it is not exhaustively classiﬁcatory in the sense that Arnhem Land or Central Desert systems are, especially these days. It is not known to what extent the absence of a classiﬁcatory system is the result of contact or whether it is a genuine difference. In addition to the kinship terms discussed here, there are also ‘para-kinship’ terms which prefer to people in a particular relation to the speaker, but which

Social organization 41
are more general than kinship terms. For example, a group of women who are in a disharmonic (inara) generation to the speaker are called inyjaab(oo), and any younger inara men would be called iwanybalini. These are not strictly kinship terms like ‘brother’ or ‘sister’, since they can be used of non-relatives, but they are terms which can only be interpreted and used with a knowledge of social organization and of the relative generational status of speaker and referent.
Marriage is only to people who are jarndoo to each other. In pre-mission times there does not seem to have been an age restriction on marriage, although there seems to have been a preference for girls marrying men of their grandparents’ generation.
The general term for someone belonging to the same country is gamoolol; the English loan gandriman ‘countryman’ is also used. Metcalfe records a word nyarroorr for a ‘close relation’, such as a sibling or cousin, but that word is not used anymore.
6.2.1. Relational terms
The Bardi kinship system is similar to the Nyulnyul one described in Schefﬂer (1978), which is in turn based on a description in Elkin (1938). My description here is based primarily on secondary sources (Aklif 1999, Elkin 1975, Gibson 1951, Robinson 1973, Schefﬂer 1978) and Gedda Aklif’s ﬁeldnotes, as I did little elicitation in this area. Kinship terms are given in Tables 2.4 and 2.5.32
Bardi kinship relies on the notion of a ‘propositus,’ or the person from whose perspective the kinship relation is calculated. In particular, many kinship terms are sensitive to the gender of the propositus (rather than to the gender of the referent). For example, there are two terms for ‘child’: aala and bo. Neither are sensitive to the gender of the referent, and so could be used to translate both ‘son’ and ‘daughter’. However, the terms are sensitive to the gender of the propositus, with aala used to refer to the child of a man, and bo the child of a woman. Other terms are neutral with respect to the gender of the propositus. Birrii ‘mother’ and go˙oloo ‘father’, for example, do not change depending on whether a man’s parent or a woman’s parent is under discussion.
There are four distinct grandparent terms. Thus mother’s mother, father’s mother, father’s father, and mother’s father are all uniquely named. The

same terms are used for the corresponding grandchild relationships. While the grandparent terms are not sensitive to the gender of the propositus, the grandchild terms are. Goli, for example, means a (man’s or woman’s) father’s mother, or a woman’s son’s child (male or female).
There are some synonymous kinship terms. Yagoo and babaramban, for example, are both used to mean a man’s brother-in-law (that is, a man’s wife’s brother). Yagoo is said by Robinson (1973) to be a recent loan from Malay; more probably it spread from a Pama-Nyungan language through the pearling industry. Likewise, rambarr and gamardnyarr are both alternatives for a man’s wife’s uncle (mother’s brother). In 2011, Bessie Ejai suggested that the term oomarl was not restricted to Jawi, but was also used in Bardi.
Kinship relations are gradient in this area, according to speakers. That is, ties are more closely enforced with people from (geographically) closer groups, while those further away are treated less strictly. Not everyone is exhaustively classiﬁed and referred to by a kinship term.
Some terms from English are used these days. Jija ‘sister’ is a longstanding loan. Nana is used for grandmothers. There is also a term ‘little daddy’, for someone who would be called go˙oloo (e.g. a father’s father’s sister’s son) who is younger than the propositus. It is also used for a greatgrandchild.
Some kinship terms are often possessed; this is especially true in the Laves corpus for birrii ‘mother’ and go˙oloo ‘father’.
6.2.2. Address and reference terms
Some kinship terms are both address and reference terms; that is, they are used both when talking about the relation, and when talking to them. Most terms are the same for address and reference, but a few are different:
(2.1) a. gamarda ‘mother’s mother’: address term gamini b. jamoo ‘mother’s father’: address term nyami c. jaal(a) ‘cross cousin’: address term jaji
I have examples where the address terms are also used as reference terms. Nyami, for example, can be used to refer to a person’s mother’s father in a story, just as someone telling a story in English might use ‘dad’ or ‘daddy’ as a reference term instead of ‘father’. I do not have any data about baby talk

Social organization 45
terms for mother and father, except for babili, a reference term for ‘brother’ that children also use as an address term. Bardi kinship terms are still widely used in English at One Arm Point.
6.2.3. Dyadic and group terms
In addition to the relationship terms described above, Bardi has a number of kinship group (dyadic) terms which are used to refer to members of a group who have a particular relationship to one another. They are summarized in Table 2.6. Data are from Robinson (1973), Aklif’s annotations on a copy of Robinson (1973) and Aklif (1999), and my ﬁeld notes.33 There are some slight differences in deﬁnition among the sources. For example, both Aklif and I have recorded marrirborl in the meaning of ‘a group of people who call each other sister’, whereas Robinson (1973:327) deﬁnes it as any people who call each other sibling (including Z and B, etc). Robinson (1973) consistently quotes forms with ﬁnal vowels, whereas I have recorded most of these terms without ﬁnal vowels (cf. golinyarr ∼ golinyarra). Additional kin designations which were not recorded by Robinson (1973) but which do appear in Aklif (1999) are given in parentheses. Robinson (1973:327) gives the grandparent dyad terms as referring both to a group of people of the same generation (MM + MMB + MMZ) and to groups of MM and DS (etc), though Aklif (1999) and I have only recorded these terms in the multi-generational meanings. A few of these terms have distinct address terms; for example, algoor is the term used by men who are jarndoo to one another to address each other.
Table 2.6 contains two types of dyadic term; the ﬁrst are true dyads, in that they refer to pairs of people who have particular relationships to one another. Alabal (a husband’s sister and wife’s brother) and aalamalarr (a man’s wife and his children) are of this type. Some of these terms can also be used to refer to a group of people whose relationships are deﬁned with respect to the speaker or propositus rather than to each other. They would be more appropriately labeled ‘kinship collectives.’ For example, nyamigamarda are not people who call each other ‘mother’s father’ and ‘mother’s mother’, but rather the set of people whom the propositus calls mother’s father and mother’s mother. Some of the terms are ambiguous; jamoonyarr, for example, can mean either ‘people who call each other jamoo’ (that is, a person’s mother’s father and

their daughter’s child), or it can mean ‘a group of people that the speaker calls jamoo.’

6.2.4. Bereavement terms
Bardi has a set of bereavement terms in addition to the regular kinship address and reference terms. These are roughly the equivalent of the English terms ‘widow’ (or ‘widower’) and ‘orphan’ but are more extensive. They collapse some of the distinctions made in the relationship terms described in the previous sections. Laves gives singular and group forms for some of these terms; thus a mirajina is a group of sisters who have lost a sister, with miraj being the singular. Laves gives jo˙omboo as another term for a bereaved sister, but it is recorded by both Aklif and me as the term for a brother who has lost a sibling. Not all speakers recognize this term, however. Jilarr is given in some sources as the bereavement term for a married brother only, but current speakers say that the bereaved brother does not have to be married for the term to apply.

The bereaved sibling terms apply also to other relatives at the same harmonic generation levels; that is, they refer not only to bereaved sisters or brothers, but also to grandparents.

48 Bardi Ethnography
6.2.5. Other kinship terms
There are some other terms which are collective in function. That is, they refer to groups of people who have generational relationships to one another. These are given in (2.2).
(2.2) a. iwanybalini ‘group of younger men who are inara to the propositus’
b. inyjaaboo ‘an older woman who is inara to the propositus’ c. jalbid ‘an older woman who is jarndoo to the propositus’ d. jimaarral ‘age-mate, person who has been through initiation with
the propositus’ e. ngalmangan ‘a group of women’s children’
In addition to the kinship terms discussed above, there are also a few special named relations between people who are inar(a) to each other, including between a man and his mother’s brother who would be his sponsor through initiation. This relationship is called jawooloo.
6.3. Kin-based taboos
There are several interactional taboos based on kinship. A woman and her son-in-law (daughter’s husband) may not meet or interact in any way; they may not sit at the same campﬁre (or these days in the same car or be in the same house). They may not talk, even through an intermediary. This taboo is especially strictly enforced with the oldest daughter’s husband; less so with the younger children. Gibson (1951:17) reported that on Sunday Island the men would sit at the back of the church, and arrive after (and leave before) the women, so as to avoid potential interaction with tabooed kin.
Opposite sex siblings have limited interaction; they do not address one another directly. This takes place from puberty. There are also a couple of ‘respect’ relations; one is between a mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law (son’s wife ∼ husband’s mother); daughters-in-law are expected to provide food gifts for their mother-in-law and to be generally respectful. Gibson (1951:15) says that a man’s mother’s brother’s wife is also an avoidance relation.
There were a few circumstances where an aloorr might cease to observe the taboos and start to be treated as a regular child. The phrase for this is

Social organization 49
garool innyagal langan (literally ‘he/she strokes a shoulder’). It is not clear under what circumstances this could happen.
Other relationship pairs cannot say the names of each other directly. The main pairs for this are aloorr, rangan, and gaarra. A person cannot say the name of another person who is related to them in one of these ways.
6.4. Marriage systems
As described in §2.6.1 above, Bardi people had a pair of egocentric moieties, termed jarndoo (for ego’s generation and other harmonic generations, such as those of the gradparents and grandchildren), and inara for the disharmonic generations (ego’s parents and children). The only possible marriage was between people who were in the jarndoo relationship to each other. However, there is some reference in the early anthropological literature to there being other preferences in choosing marriages too. For example, it was preferable for the women to be in the grandchildren’s generation of the husband.34 Men could take more than one wife, although it is difﬁcult to tell how widespread polygamy was. I also have no information on the usual number of wives that a man could have. If a man died, it was customary for one of his brothers to marry his wife and take care of his family. If the husband died, however, the woman had a choice about whether to accept or reject the brother’s marriage; if she rejected it, she was expected to return to her own clan and country.
Little is known about traditional Bardi marriage patterns beyond the constraints on marriage to someone who is jarndoo. There is a special word irrbanbin to refer to a marriage where a pair of brothers marry a pair of sisters. This was a preferred marriage. In addition, there is some evidence that marriage was clan-based and clan exogamous. That is, a person would not marry someone from the same patriclan. Men from Sunday Island appear to have married women from Oowini country; women from Sunday Island may have married men from that area too. Men from Pender Bay seem to have married Nyulnyul women. Elkin (1932:308) describes the marriage principle as “little bit long way”; Elkin suggests that “long way” here refers both to geographic distance and to distance kinship reckoning, that one should not be too closely related to one’s potential spouse, but not too distant from them either. Some speakers describe Bardi marriage as primarily linguistically endogamous while being clan-exogamous (that is, Bardi speakers from a different area were preferred); this accords with Elkin’s description. Elkin

50 Bardi Ethnography
(1932:308) claims that although second cousin marriage is dispreferred, marriage between a man and his sister’s son’s daughter is possible, so long as the sister’s son’s wife was a proper marriage. Elkin (1932:310) also notes that a difference between the Bardi and Nyulnyul systems is the classiﬁcation of the mother’s mother’s brother’s son (MMBS), who is a ‘father’ in Nyulnyul but a mother’s brother (gaarra) in Bardi.
There were several ways in which a marriage could be arranged. Sometimes wives were ‘stolen’ from neighboring groups. The Laves texts from the 1920s contain several stories about men who steal women (some unmarried, mostly those already married) from other areas. Some marriage involves a ‘promise’ (an arrangement that included the parents). In other cases, wives were ‘inherited’ by a younger brother when the older brother died. There were also love matches, as long as the match was licit according to other rules. The word for betrothal is balngarinjoon. When women married, they kept their patrilineal inheritance rights; that is, they were not adopted into their husband’s clan.
Post-marriage living seems to have been largely patrilocal (that is, the wife would live with her husband’s clan), though there seems to have been some variation, and some mobility of family groups among the different areas in which they had rights to live. Information on this is inferred from the Laves materials, since by the end of the 19th Century, almost all Bardi people were living in missions in a few places in Bardi country and the traditional mobility patterns were largely lost.
6.5. Class, equality, and occupational differences
While there was no socioeconomic class system, Bardi people were not all treated as socially equal. Older people (both men and women) had more social status than younger people, and men seem (from the Laves texts) to have been more powerful than women. For example, the punishments given to women for adultery were considerably more severe than those given to men, and while people had land rights through both their father’s line and through their mother, the rights accorded through their mother were considerably less than those through the patri-line.
In traditional times there was no occupational specialization, beyond certain tasks that men would do and others that women would do. Only men hunted dugong and turtle, for example. However, people did talk about dif-

Land and land tenure 51
ferences in how good different individuals were at certain tasks (for example, in raft building).
7. Land and land tenure
7.1. Language and land
In some Australian Aboriginal groups, rights to language are acquired through the land. That is, there is a close relationship between the land and the language spoken there, and people are said to speak a particular language because of their relationship with that land. This is less clear in the Dampier Peninsula. The culture hero Galaloong put the Bardi language in Bardi country (and also Baard and Jawi); he is the same hero who named the places and showed people water on the islands. However, the way speakers talk about language implies that the relationship is less direct than it is in Central Australia. For example, while land boundaries are often quite well-deﬁned, the linguistic boundaries on the Peninsula are described in more ﬂuid and fuzzy terms. Pender Bay Bardi, for example, is described as ‘Bardi comingup Nyulnyul’, and Bardi from Sunday Island is sometimes described as ‘part Bardi, part Jawi’. The places are named in a particular language, and people from a particular place speak a particular language. Thus one ﬁnds statements that ‘Goolarrgoon people speak Bard(i)’ or ‘Goolarrgoon people are Bard(i)’ but not that ‘the Bard(i) language belongs to this area’.
7.2. Ownership
Land tenure was collective. The primary basis for land tenure in Bardi country was through the patrilineal estate, or booroo. McGregor (in press) characterizes land tenure of this type as being restricted to males, however the women I have worked with were fairly clear that they had rights to land through their father too. These rights appear to have been of several kinds (see also Sutton 2003). They included right of free access. One can visit and stay in one’s booroo without notifying the owners of that land, while those without rights must ask permission; this applies to both men and women. It also includes rights to the resources on that land, such as ﬁsh, and hunting; it probably also included the rights to conduct ceremonies on the irrganyji ‘lawground’ in that country.

52 Bardi Ethnography
In addition to rights to one’s booroo, there were also secondary rights to one’s mother’s country, or ningalmoo.35 The boundaries to the patrilineal estates seem not to have been clearly marked. The booroo consist of one or more focal camps, places surrounding them, and the area between.
I do not have good data on the inheritance of patrilineal estates when the line dies out: senior Bardi men made provisions for who can assume the management of such estates when the family has all died out in accordance with traditional law, but I don’t know what they are.
There are numerous deﬁned camps within Bardi country, which people would travel between. Some were only good at certain times of the year. For example, some places were infested with mosquitoes at some times, so would not be used. Others were particularly used at the time of year when the community would be on the lookout for mating turtles. Other camps are talked of in terms of ‘holidays’; that is, of places where small family groups would go for a time to hunt and ﬁsh, and where the kids would play. Bessie Ejai says that most of the traveling happened in the dry season.
7.3. Place names
A detailed discussion of Bardi place names is given in Bowern (2009) and so only a cursory summary is provided here.36 I concentrate on salient features of the toponym system.
The term Wardiyabulu refers to the Dampierland groups (or sometimes just the most northern ones) and their country. It is a Nyikina or Yawuru term in origin. Within Bardi country, place names are organized hierarchically.
7.3.1. Areas
There are seven named areas within the country; these were given in Map 0.3 on page xxxvii above. The mainland area is divided into four roughly equal quadrants. Goolarrgoon is the north-western area comprising the modern resort area of Cape Leveque and environs. Goowalgar is the area south of Goolarrgoon, on the western side of the Peninsula as far as Pender Bay. An alternative name for this area in Robinson (1973:103) is Olonggon, which means ‘in the south’. On the eastern side of the peninsula, there is Ardiyol, the area including the community of One Arm Point, and Baanarrad, centered around Galan (Skeleton Point). The interior of the Dampier Peninsula was uninhabited and is sometimes talked about as not belonging to any area.

Land and land tenure 53
The other three areas pertain to the islands off the tip of the Dampier Peninsula. The ﬁfth ‘area’ is Iwany, which comprises the three islands together called Sunday Island on English maps. It also includes the islands immediately to the north (such as Ralooraloo) and the islands/rocks in Sunday Strait. The sixth area is Iinalabooloo, the islands between Sunday Island and the mainland. The seventh area name is Mayala, the islands of the Buccaneer Archipelago east-north-east of Sunday Island.
7.3.2. Booroo (patrilineal estates)
Within each area, there are a number of booroo. The word translates as ‘camp, ground, place’. It refers to a patrilineal estate, a place which would be owned by a group which formed an important part of Bardi social organization. Booroo are geographically much smaller than areas; for example, there are at least 20 booroo in the Goolarrgoon area. The booroo names are often also island names; thus Jayirri is both an island and a booroo, as is Jalan. Other islands may contain several booroo, as for example Sunday Island (Iwany). In some cases the location of the booroo has been lost and is recorded only in the name. In other cases, such as Albooloogoon and Narrigoon, the location is known. These days some booroo names are well known, but many have been lost. The booroo names on Sunday Island (Iwany) are only known to the oldest Bardi people. In this case, Iwany is now used the way that the name Jayirri is used, even though Jayirri was a booroo/island name and Iwany was an area term. Several mainland booroo names, such as Ngamoogoon, Gambarnan and Boolgin, are still frequently used.
Booroo names for Bardi country are given in map 2.4, and the key to the map is given in Table 2.8. Data for the map is taken from Aklif’s and my ﬁeld notes, and supplemented by Robinson (1973:112ff). The placement of some of these booroo differs between the map in Robinson (1973:112) and my own notes. Jamalalgoon, for example, is given as a booroo name on the northern shore of Pender Bay by Robinson (1973); in my notes, however, it is the name for the tidal creek (iidarr) behind the large sandbar on the southern entrance to Pender Bay. Since Robinson was working 25 years before me, with older people, his placements may be considered more accurate; on the other hand, I checked locations using Google Earth satellite imagery for places which we could not visit in person. I do not know if Robinson’s booroo location ﬁeldwork was done with maps or by traveling to sites. Note

54 Bardi Ethnography also that not all names here were conﬁrmed by me as being booroo names. Unconﬁrmed names are asterisked. The area around Garramal (Cunningham Point) has few names in my ﬁeld notes; speakers thought that there were more names but did not recall them. Spelling is from my ﬁeld notes, since Robinson’s phonemicization is unreliable. I take Robinson’s assignment of booroo to areas as deﬁnitive on the mainland. Robinson does not distinguish Iinalabooloo from Iwany and Mayala areas; I have distinguished them here. There were most probably more Mayala booroo than are given here. Figure 2.4. Booroo (patilineal estates) in Bardi country
7.3.3. Locality names Each booroo contains multiple speciﬁcally named places within it. These may refer to different topological features, such as tidal creeks (iidarra), rocks (goolboo), reefs (marnany), caves (gardin), hills (garrin), or small bays, or they may refer to a piece of land behind the shore. Occasionally they also refer to man-made features, such as the large permanent ﬁsh traps

(mayoorroo) around One Arm Point. Locality names typically refer to a feature, but the name will also be applied to the ground surrounding that feature. Thus Jaybimilj refers speciﬁcally to two submarine depressions (where ﬁsh congregate) in the tidal channel between Iwany and Oombinarr; however it also refers to the stretch of the passage where the depressions are located (the passage as a whole is called Jaybi).
Place names are heavily concentrated around the coast. In the Laves texts, for example, places inland are usually referred to by their booroo name, whereas more speciﬁc locality names are used for areas along the coast. Bardi people are primarily coastal dwellers and seemed to have seldom camped inland. This makes sense in an area where the sea is a far more fruitful resource than the land, and where there is no permanent surface water
While booroo names are unique within Bardi country, locality names are not. Thus there is only one booroo called Albooloogoon, but there are multiple places called Mardaj. Where disambiguation is necessary, the booroo name is given as well. Thus Jayirri Mardaj is the Mardaj on Jayirri. Iilon is another common name. The places named Mardaj are all reefs, and places named Iilon are all valleys inland, away from the coast.
8. Ceremonial and religious life
8.1. Mythology
Much documentation of Bardi spiritual and supernatural stories has occurred over the last hundred years. This part of the culture straddles the restricted and public: from what I understand, most of this information exists in several layers depending on the appropriate audience. For example, the bad spirit stories are used to frighten children and are freely told, but they are also part of the adult belief system with additional layers of meaning. Some types of spirits appear to men in dreams and give them songs. Some of those songs are restricted. Doctors are able to pass between this world and the shadow world and many aspects of their knowledge also involve restricted topics.
Some of these stories and spirit beings are common throughout the Kimberley region, whereas others seem to be restricted to Bardi. Conception totems or ‘spirit children’ (raya; see below) are widespread and the same term is also used throughout the Western and Northern Kimberley (Coate 1966). The concept of Dreaming stories is also extremely widespread. The

58 Bardi Ethnography
Rainbow Serpent ﬁgure is of course famous (ingoodoog), but is not seen to be typical in Bardi (this is an esoteric story in northern Kimberley cultures). It does not appear to be a central part of Bardi law, unlike some of the Desert cultures. Doctors and shadow worlds also appear to vary across the region, but elements of the Bardi culture and stories are also found at least in Bunuba, for instance in the Jandamarra resistance stories (Pedersen and Woorunmurra 1995).
8.2. Spirit beings
In traditional Bardi culture there were two types of spirit beings: benevolent spirits and evil spirits. The bad spirits are the spirits of dead people and attack people, particularly children, while the good or neutral spirits are a different type of being. They do not attack people.
There are four different types of good or neutral spirits. Ingarda live in mangroves and underground. They are the spirits who bring ilma to singers (see below). Raya are conception totems (see further Coate 1966), also called ‘spirit children.’ Conception totems are the totems which are associated with a child’s birth or conception. They take several forms. For example, if a man spears a ﬁsh with a distinctive mark and his child is later born with that same distinctive mark, this is evidence that the ﬁsh was a raya spirit and the ﬁsh is the conception totem for the child. In other cases, the conception totem might be an animal associated with the particular place where a woman ﬁrst found out she was pregnant. Another word for raya is ngarrgalala.
Mirridid spirits are little people from a long time ago. They lived in giidoonoo (little grass huts). Laves text 75 (see texts in Appendix E) is about this spirit. Mirrididi were fairy children who lived all through the area. When a stranger came to a new place, the mirridid would come up to him at night asking for their father. They could take the form of animals, just like raya spirit children. If someone killed a mirridi/kangaroo during the day, at night in the camp the kangaroo would change back to a mirridid and say ‘now I’ll call you dad, because you speared me.’ They mostly came to men, but they could come to women too. They are a little like raya spirits, except that raya can still be felt and seen on the islands in Bardi country, but the mirrididi have all gone now.
Go˙owa are mermaid-like creatures. They are fair-colored women with long hair, and used to help people when they went ﬁshing, for example by

Ceremonial and religious life 59
duplicating spears as they were thrown so that two spears would hit the ﬁsh rather than one. Bessie Ejai saw them when she was a little girl. If someone sees a go˙owa and then tells someone else that they have seen one, they will not see her again.
The bad spirits are ngaarri and layoordoo. Ngaarri is the usual translation for ‘devil’ these days. It also formerly had a technical meaning of the ghost of a person who has not yet left the area and gone to Looman, the land of the dead, far to the west of Bardi country. They take the form of curlews (iindoo). Layoordoo spirits steal wives and cut the cheeks off children.
8.3. Songs and song language
Bardi music is mostly sung, and there are several types of songs, both accompanied and unaccompanied. Bardi music is not polyphonic. There are six main types of music:
(2.3) a. Sacred restricted songs; initiation songs (the names of which include mangali, arnkooy, oolooloong, and iinbala; these songs not further discussed here)
b. Public sacred music (ilma) c. Increase songs (e.g. nganynginy) d. Entertainment songs; ‘made-in-the-head’ songs (loodin) e. Christian hymns f. Country music and pop music
Songs may be either restricted or non-restricted. The restricted songs include those sung in certain parts of initiation ceremonies. There are also public songs that also have a restricted meaning. An important song type is the ilma, which are a set of song cycles for public performance. It is the main genre of ceremonial music performed today. Ilma are not composed by individuals; rather they are ‘dreamt’ – that is, given to people in a dream, and their task is to interpret the spirit song into the language of ilma. There are only two named ilma cycles currently known: Ruby’s ilma and Billy Ah Choo’s ilma. Ruby’s ilma seems to have had a greater restricted component than Billy Ah Choo’s does. See A’Choo (c. 1991), Bowern (2007a) for more information.
Ilma language is similar to regular spoken Bardi, though there are a few differences (some of these are performance differences). Verbs are typically

60 Bardi Ethnography
sufﬁxless in ilma, though they may contain a past tense marker or the ﬁller syllable sufﬁx -ngay. They are telegraphic and there is a lot of metaphor in song language. There is also stress shift and vowel centralization.
There are some ‘increase’ songs recorded by Alice Moyle in 1968. These are songs which are sung in order to ensure a good catch of turtle or ﬁsh. Such songs were not rerecorded by me and seem to have been lost as a performance type, though the texts and context of the songs are still known.
There were also songs for cutting up dugong or turtle, such as (2.4) below:

The words are not identiﬁable as Bardi, though they have Bardi phonotactics, and the last word looks like a transitive verb inﬂected in the past tense with a ﬁrst person subject, but the root is not identiﬁable.
Another major genre of song text is loodin. Unlike ilma songs, which are not composed but given to their owners in a dream, loodin songs are composed by individuals in response to an event or image that is deemed to be song-worthy. There are a number of loodin songs from the Second World War, when Broome was bombed and the Sunday Island Mission was evacuated. Loodin songs are typically fairly short (a few minutes in length) and have at most a few verses. Subject matter for the verses include things like the sight of a wallaby swimming in the sea to a nearby island, the sound of bomber planes overhead, or the pain at being stung by a stoneﬁsh. A feature of both ilma and loodin songs is a device which I have called ‘telescoping’ (Bowern 2007a). An event is described by a single component, which becomes evocative of the scene as a whole.
More recently, several Christian hymns have been translated into Bardi and are still regularly sung. The Broome-based Pigram Brothers band includes Bardi lyrics in some of their songs.
8.4. Initiation grades
Bardi male initiation is still practiced. There are several stages of the ceremonies, and they include both restricted and public components; both men and women participate in the ceremonies, but with different roles. Information on traditional ceremonies (considerably more information than would be released today) has been published in articles from the 1940s and 1950s.

Ceremonial and religious life 61
The stages of initiation have public names; the entries from Aklif (1999) are summarized here. The ﬁrst initiation stage is called arnkooy, while the second is oolooloong. Within each ceremony, there are a number of stages that the boys pass through. Some of the terms are used back in camp to refer to the boys while they are in seclusion in the lawground (called irrganyji in Bardi).
(2.5) a. niyamniyam: Boy who is ready for the arnkooy ceremony; the term applies particularly to when the boy is in the irrganyji ‘law ground’;
b. layanyarr: Boy who has been painted all over with fat and black paint for the arnkooy ceremony;
c. balili: Boy who has ﬁnished the arnkooy (ﬁrst initiation stage) ceremony, after he has come out from the irrganyji (lawground);
d. joodoor(oo): Boy who is in the Oolooloong ceremony; e. jamoonoonggoorr: Boy who has ﬁnished the oolooloong (second
initiation stage) ceremony; f. gambil: In another oolooloong ceremony, gambil boys get hand-
strings to wear. They cannot eat ﬁsh at this stage; g. roonggoorr: The following year, they get eagle feathers in their
hair, and become roonggoorr; h. boongan(a): Once the boy has a hair belt and pearlshell, he is
boongana; i. ilyboorr : This is the stage at which they get red paint; j. mambangan: The ﬁnal stage, after they have been painted with
red paint, the boy is fully initiated. They are allowed to marry after this.
The names of the ceremonial grades are based on a variety of different strategies; some are atomistic, others are analytical (e.g. layanyarr means ‘fat-COM’).
8.5. Funerals
Bardi funeral practices traditionally involved exposing the body for a period of time by placing it upright in a ‘cradle’ mounted on a platform in the fork

62 Bardi Ethnography
of a tree. This is the ‘tree cofﬁn.’ The bones are later placed in a pillow made of paperbark, or left, with just a piece of hair being preserved. People would have to avoid the area with the jarrgandiny ‘tree cofﬁn’ for three days.
8.6. Rock art
There is rock art in Bardi country. It is restricted, and so precise locations are not given here. Metcalfe recorded a story about magical rock art in the area of Swan Point. The pictures cannot be erased; they return if they are rubbed out or washed away. In the early days of European settlement in the area, someone tried to take a photograph of a cave painting, but the ground collapsed under the camera before the photograph could be taken (Nancy Isaac, BOW3/47, 2001); this was seen as an indication that the art was special and photos of it should not be taken.
9. Personal names
Bardi people traditionally had several different names. In addition to their ‘bush’ name, they would commonly by known by their booroo name; that is, the booroo or area that their family owns, and a nickname. After the missions were founded, most people had and used a European name too. Gibson (1951) mentions that men would also receive a secret name at initiation, which would be used only during ceremonies.
Nicknames are formed with several different strategies. They might be given after an event, or based on baby-talk, or someone can be named for another person with the same nickname. For example, Gedda Aklif’s nickname was Janjan because she is very tall, just like someone else with that name, while my nickname among some Bardi people is langijmijij (lit. ‘language woman’). The nickname is also used when the person can be spoken to but the name is taboo; there is no general term which replaces necronyms, such as kumanytyayi in Central Australia.
Names (apart from nicknames) were seldom used. People were seldom addressed directly with their name; instead, a kinship term or a vocative address such as oy, anggaba ‘hey you’ (lit. ‘who/someone’) is used. Older Bardi people still use you anggaba as a way of addressing people. Some relatives cannot call others by name directly. It is also not permitted for someone who

Language use 63
has the same name to use that name with someone else; the word for ‘namesake’ is goombali and such people are referred to as ‘my goombali’ even in English. Name taboos are still generally observed, especially by older people.
English names do not have the same usage restrictions that Bardi names do (it was more than 5 years before I was told the Bardi names of some of the people I had worked with very closely). Bardi names are special; they are not used for address these days, although they are found in the Laves texts when talking about people. Names are used with talking about people, but nicknames are more common. Nicknames are used to address people directly, if the person can be addressed. Some names cannot be said if they are a taboo relative; opposite sex sibling names are usually not used, particularly the names of a woman’s elder brother, though younger brothers seem not to be subject to quite the same stricture.
10. Language use
10.1. Ancillary languages
Bardi does not have a public ancillary language such as ‘mother-in-law’ language. I have no information about initiation language use. I do not have enough data to draw any conclusions for respect registers, except that there are deﬁnitely intonation and volume differences when talking to someone with whom there is a respect relationship.
10.2. Baby talk
Bardi has a baby talk register. It is not used much these days, as child-directed speech tends to be in English, and when asked about it, speakers preferred to record adult speech as a better model for the children to follow. Baby talk is characterized by higher pitch (F0) of the utterance and greater variation in intonation contours. There is considerable repetition of lexical items. There are some phonological substitutions, with l for r being the most common (see (2.6) below). There are some lexical substitutions, including nyamnyam ‘food’ for regular Bardi aarlimayi, boojbooj ‘fat’ for laya, and gajoo ‘father’s father’ for galoongoord. In complex predicate constructions, the preverb is used without the inﬂecting (light) verb, as in (2.6):

64 Bardi Ethnography
(2.6) Baby talk: loowil! Adult Bardi: roowil a-n-nya walk 2-TR-‘catch’ ‘Walk!’
Such constructions are not at all a feature of the adult register, where there are no general conditions under which light verbs are omitted. Finally, ergative case marking tends to be omitted in this register.

10.3. Greetings, thanks, and leave taking

Modern greetings in Bardi are calqued on the English ones, with the exception of anggi jawal ‘what’s new’, which seems to be older, and is used as a greeting like ‘hello’, Other greetings are given in (2.7).

(2.7) a. gorna mooyoon good morning

‘good morning’

b. gorna injooloolin good afternoon

‘good afternoon’

c. nyirroogoordoo mi-n-kal

how

2-TR-go

‘How are you?’

There are no Bardi words for please or thank you, but gala gorna ‘it’s good’ is used to express appreciation.
The word for good-bye is joorrgo. It is used when the people will not meet again for a long time. For example, it is appropriate to say joorrgo at the end of a ﬁeld season, but not at the end of a day’s work, when something like the phrases in (2.8) are appropriate. They are probably also calques from English.

(2.8) a. Garrma ngankalarri. Garrma nga-n-k-al-a=rri later 1-TR-FUT-see-FUT=2M.DO
‘I’ll see you later.’

b. Ngoorriji ngankalarri. Ngoorriji nga-n-k-al-a=rri tomorrow 1-TR-FUT-see-FUT=2M.DO
‘I’ll see you tomorrow.’

Language use 65

10.4. View of surrounding languages

McGregor (in press) notes in his Nyulnyul grammar that Nyulnyul people viewed the Bardi language as something of a local ‘killer’ language; that is, one that people were expected to talk in. There is some mention of Bardi borrowings, and the default assumption for words of unknown origin is that they “must be Bardi.” This ﬁts the anecdotal reports from Sunday Island that Oowini wives of Sunday Island Bardi men were expected to learn Bardi.
It is interesting to compare the languages which are defaulted to as the “it must be a word of language X,” if a word is not recognized as being Bardi. For Bardi people, unknown words are presumed to be either from Oowini (a Worrorran language of the islands adjacent to Bardi country) or occasionally Nyikina. The Nyikina words were given as responses to words in Nekes and Worms (1953) and Metcalfe (1975a); some of the words are indeed found in Nyikina, though others did not appear in the Nyikina materials available to me. Very little is known of the Oowini language. It is quite possible that some Nyikina words entered Bardi in the 1960s and 1970s, after the Sunday Island mission closed and Bardi people moved to Derby.37
Although Bardi people appear on the whole to have been monolingual,38 they were not exclusively so, and they did trade and interact with their neighbors. Some Bardi people knew at least some Nyulnyul too. David Wiggan recorded a narrative about life on Sunday Island in the Mission period where he comments that different groups lived ‘with their own people’:

11. Recent history of the Dampier Peninsula
This section gives a brief history of the region, both Indigenous and European.
11.1. Bardi origin stories
Dixon (1996) quotes a Bardi origin myth which gives the view that Bardi people’s ancestors originally came from the northwest of Bardi country. This would be a place over the Indian Ocean, assuming the current location of Bardi territory. The myth might have been told by the late David Wiggan to Gedda Aklif; however I have been unable to substantiate this story from other Bardi speakers and it is not among Aklif’s recorded or transcribed stories, nor any other transcribed texts that I have been able to ﬁnd. When I asked about the story, I was told that such a story is not part of Bardi culture, and Bardi people have always lived in the area. There is a common view amongst Aboriginal people (at least in the Kimberley) that origin myths such as the one mentioned by Dixon (1996) were recently invented by Europeans in order to invalidate Native Title claims.39 Bardi people traditionally believe that the culture hero Galaloong brought the Bardi language to the area by walking over the whole of Bardi country, naming all the places.
11.2. Archaeology of the Western Kimberley
Archaeological work in the general region of the coastal Western Kimberley indicates that there has been human settlement in the area for at least 30,000 years (Mulvaney and Kamminga 1999). The oldest shell middens on Koolan Island, in the extreme north of the Buccaneer Archipelago, are of approximately this age. O’Connor (1999) is a study of mainland coastal and island sites in this area; she found that sites on Koolan and High Cliffy Island had been abandoned around 23,000 BP and resettled around 10,000 BP.
There is no published archaeological work which relates directly to Bardi traditional country. Although a conﬁdential site report does exist (Bindon 1978), I have not had access to it, and it probably does not contain dated materials. Work on the land claim over Bardi/Jawi traditional country perhaps involved carbon or thermo-luminescence dating of sites in Bardi country, but is sub judice even though the claim is now resolved.

Recent history of the Dampier Peninsula 67
11.3. First contacts with Europeans
The people whom William Dampier met when he landed to scrape his boat in Cygnet Bay (just inside King Sound) in 1687 were Bardi people. The episode is described in some detail in A New Voyage round the World, (Dampier 1699). Compare also Katie W. Drysdale’s telling of the story in December 2001 (ﬁeld tape 36/3). This encounter also provides us with the earliest known recording of a word in an Australian Aboriginal language: gaari!, probably ngaarri, i.e. ‘devil’.
Dampier’s description includes the use of stone weirs, or ﬁsh traps (ayin or mayoorroo) for catching ﬁsh at low tide. Dampier’s comment that the people he saw were eating only ﬁsh and nothing else probably reﬂects the time of year; he landed in March, at the very end of the wet season, when turtle, dugong and stingray (and many ﬁsh species) cannot be hunted and when almost no bush fruit is ripe. This is ngaladany season.
11.4. Pearlers and blackbirding
Northern Australia’s pearling industry began in the late nineteenth century, centered around Broome and the shallow warm waters of King Sound. The industry had a devastating effect on the Aboriginal groups since they were often coerced into working on the boats, and several pearlers left their crew on the Lacepede islands40 to starve to death at the end of each season. Yawuru, Karajarri and Jawi people were particularly affected, although all the coastal groups suffered raids. The Lacepedes were also used to ‘break’ recalcitrant potential pearl divers.
11.5. Mission period
The next period of contact began towards the end of the 19th Century, when the Durack family (and a few others) began bringing cattle into northern Western Australia overland from Queensland and the Northern Territory. A Mission was established at Beagle Bay (in Nyulnyul Country) in 1890, on Sunday Island before 1900, and at Lombadina in 1911 (Nekes and Worms 1953:19-20). Durack (1969) is a historical novel of the mission period (1878– 1967), but is based on original sources and gives the missionary perspective.

68 Bardi Ethnography
The missions seem to have been set up in this area partly to offer shelter to Aboriginal people from the pearlers and from the punitive police raids.
Much could be said about the integration of Christianity into Bardi traditional culture. It seems that in the early years, the missionaries made some attempt to learn Bardi, and to ﬁnd parallels between Christianity and Bardi belief systems. This has led to a series of Bardi narratives in which ﬁgures from the Bible are equated with Bardi Culture Heroes and their activities are placed within Bardi country. For example, there are stories about the effects of Noah’s ﬂood on Bardi country, and Bessie Ejai and David Wiggan have recorded narratives about the Culture Hero and law ﬁgure Galaloong, who ascended into Heaven on Jooloom Island.
The Mission period continued until the 1960s. Drysdale, Durack, and Bauers (1974) describes life on the Sunday Island Mission. The Sunday Island Mission was closed in 1962 (the reason given was that the island was too small for an air strip, which would be needed to evacuate any severely ill Aboriginal people on the island). The Aboriginal people living on Sunday Island were forcibly removed to Mowanjun Community, a predominantly Ngarinyin community in Warrwa country, on the outskirts of Derby. It was at this time that many Bardi people started to speak only English (sometimes by choice, sometimes by force). Almost all Bardi people born after the move to Derby do not speak Bardi ﬂuently.
11.6. One Arm Point Community
The community at One Arm Point (Ardiyooloon ["aãiyulun]) was founded in about 1974, following pressure on the Western Australian Department of Native Affairs by David Drysdale (a missionary based in Derby and husband of the late Katie Wiggan-Drysdale, a Bardi woman) and members of the Bardi community after a few Bardi families moved back to Bardi country from Derby. They initially camped on the beach at Middle Beach (Galbarrnginy) until houses, a shop, and a school could be built. The community now has a school which takes pupils from kindergarten to Year 10 (students go to a high school in Broome or boarding school for the ﬁnal years of school), a shop, a turtle hatchery program, council ofﬁces, a clinic, an unpaved air-strip, and a workshop staffed by the Bardi-Jaawi rangers.

Recent history of the Dampier Peninsula 69
11.7. The current language program
The Bardi language is currently taught as a subject to all students at One Arm Point community school, as part of the language and culture curriculum. There are also language programs at schools in the area (at Lombadina/Djarrindjin Community and Broome, for example), which involve Bardi. The One Arm Point program has been in place since 1990, and is likely to be one of the longest continually running language programs in Western Australia. These days, the language program focuses on cultural activities and the language required to talk about those activities in Bardi. The younger children also learn Bardi songs and English nursery songs in Bardi, such as ‘heads, shoulders, knees and toes’ (ngalma, langana, ngaamidi, ngayambala in Bardi). By ﬁeldwork has resulted in some teaching materials for the school program, such as a digital Bardi dictionary, a few story books, and readers for intermediate to advanced language learners, but the vast majority of the work for the language program has been done by local teachers and members of the Bardi community.

Chapter 3 Phonetics and Phonology
Bardi is, in terms of phonology, the least conservative of the Nyulnyulan languages. Although contrastive vowel length is retained from Proto-Nyulnyulan, additional long vowels and an additional phoneme o have arisen through the lenition of intervocalic stops and deletion of intervocalic glides. Nasal dissimilation and cluster reduction have created a new series of intervocalic obstruents and vowel elision has created new consonant clusters. These changes make some Bardi words appear rather different from their Nyulnyulan cognates, and have led to complex alternations in the morphology which obscure root boundaries.
This chapter covers three areas. The ﬁrst is a general description of the phonetic realization of segments, a description of the phoneme system, and phonotactics (§3.1 and following). The second is an analysis of morphophonology, including afﬁx interaction and morphophonemic alternations which have resulted from the morphologization of certain sound changes. There are regular processes which occur throughout Bardi, although in addition there are some morphologized and lexicalized alternations (not strictly phonologically ‘regular’) and a few alternations which apply only to verbal preﬁxes. These are discussed in §3.6. Bardi has no lexical tone system. In §3.9 I give some information about the intonation system. Finally, in §3.10 I give a description of loanword adaptation.41
1. Consonants
1.1. Phoneme inventory
As previously described in Aklif (1999) and Metcalfe (1971), Bardi has seventeen consonants and seven vowels.42 Bardi is typical for Australian languages in making a contrast between ﬁve places of articulation for consonants: there is a distinction in stops, nasals and laterals between apicodental, apico-palatal/domal (retroﬂex) and lamino-palatal places of articulation. Stops and nasals are also contrasted at velar and labial positions. There are two rhotics, a tap/trill and a (retroﬂex) glide. There are two other glides,

72 Phonetics and Phonology
y and w. There are no fricatives and voicing is not contrastive, although stops alternate allophonically and also frequently lenite intervocalically (more on this below). In other ways, however, Bardi is less typical of Australian languages in phonology.
Table 3.1 gives the consonant phonemes in practical orthography, with IPA symbols in brackets where they differ from those used in the orthography. I have used the established orthography throughout rather than IPA or a modiﬁed orthography to ensure consistency between the chapters. While the standard orthography for Bardi uses voiced symbols for the stops, I follow Maddieson (1984) in assuming that the category is underlyingly unmarked for voice.

There are a few phonemic distinctions made in the language which are not reﬂected in the orthography. Most crucial is the difference between /u/ vs. /u:/. Words with /u:/ are considerably rarer than those with the short vowel; the long vowel is notated in examples as <o˙o>. The other ambiguity arises from the interpretation of digraphs. A distinction between /ñ/ and /n.j/ occurs (very rarely) across morpheme boundaries. These are given in the Bardi dictionary as pronunciation notes.
The basic phonetic value of the consonants is straightforward; they have the values expected from the IPA. In the ‘retroﬂex’ series, the contact of the tongue with the roof of the mouth is just under the tip of the tongue; the tongue is not heavily curled back and this makes the retroﬂection somewhat difﬁcult to perceive, especially in fast speech.

Consonants 73
1.2. Minimal pairs
Minimal, near minimal, and somewhat less than minimal pairs illustrating phonemic contrasts for consonants are given in Table 3.2. Minimal pairs are not easy to ﬁnd for all segments. For example, there is a word liyan ‘heart’, but there is no word which differs from it by a single consonant or vowel; the closest words are niyang ‘backwards’ (cf. niya ‘back’) or Biyana, the name of an island between the mainland and Sunday Island. Pairs contrasting r and the trill rr, however, are relatively numerous; a few are shown in (3.1).
(3.1) a. jalarra /calara/ ‘daybreak’ vs. jalara /calaõa/ ‘nothingness’ b. arra /ara/ ‘no’ vs. ara /aõa/ ‘other’ c. boorroo /puru/ ‘kangaroo (generic)’ vs. booroo /puõu/ ‘ground’ d. marr /mar/ ‘ﬂash’ vs. mar(a) /maõa/ ‘far away’
Some minimal pairs are morphologically complex; that is, a morpheme is a single consonant which differentiates two forms; compare ngalma ‘my head’, nyalma ‘your [MIN] head’, and nalma ‘his/her/its head’. The palatal and apical nasal are also distinguished monomorphemically in the pair goolany ‘baby louse’ and goolan ‘bluebone’.
1.3. Canonical realization of consonants
Canonical realizations of the 17 consonant phonemes are given below.
/p/ is a bilabial stop unspeciﬁed for voice.
/t/ is an apico-alveolar stop unspeciﬁed for voice.
/ú/ is a post-alveolar stop, produced with the tongue slightly retracted; the tongue contact appears to be mostly apical, rather than sub-apical. It is unspeciﬁed for voice.
/c/ is a lamino-palatal stop; it is unspeciﬁed for voice and often slightly affricated.
/k/ is a velar stop unspeciﬁed for voice.
/m/ is a bilabial nasal stop.

/n/ is an apico-alveolar nasal stop. /ï/ is a post-alveolar nasal stop which varies considerably in the degree of
retroﬂection it exhibits. /ñ/ is a lamino-palatal nasal stop. It frequently conditions prepalatalization
on preceding vowels. /N/ is a velar nasal. /l/ is an apico-alveolar lateral. /í/ is a post-alveolar lateral which varies considerably in the degree of
retroﬂection it exhibits. /ń/ is a lamino-palatal lateral. /r/ is an apical trill; it is also often realized as a tap. /õ/ is an apico-alveolar or post-alveolar glide. Speakers vary in its real-
ization; for most, it is a retroﬂex (or post-alveolar) glide [õ], while for others, it is an apical glide [ô]. /j/ is a palatal glide. /w/ is a labio-velar glide.
1.4. Allophonic variation
There is substantial allophonic variation in the Bardi sound system. Most of the variation in the system can be described in terms of positional allophony (that is, it is dependent on the environment in which the phone appears); there is also some speaker-dependent variation and some ‘free’ variation (that is, variation which is not conditioned by any as yet identiﬁable feature).
1.4.1. Realization of obstruents
1.4.1.1. Voicing
Bardi has a single series of stops unspeciﬁed for voice. Voicing in obstruents is, however, allophonically variable. Stops are always voiceless word ﬁnally,

76 Phonetics and Phonology
usually voiceless (and unaspirated) initially, and voiced elsewhere; see Figure 3.1 for illustrations of these positions. Intervocalically, stops are almost always voiced. They are also often slightly fricated. After nasals they are usually (but not consistently) voiced, and in other clusters voicing appears variable. (All spectrograms here show a range of 5000 Hz.)

All segments, whether consonantal or vocalic, are regularly devoiced wordﬁnally in citation forms and prepausally. Aklif, in her description of Bardi consonant variation, gives s as an allomorph of the trill word ﬁnally; however, I have only found heavily devoiced trills. Figure 3.2 provides an illustration of a ﬁnal partially devoiced segment. Obstruents may also be partially unvoiced in this position, with the voicing from the preceding vowel continuing into the stop for approximately one third to half of the length of the stop closure.

While voicing is not contrastive, using the right amount of voicing in each consonant position is an important part of speaking Bardi correctly, and the variants are not in ‘free variation’ in the usual sense of the term. I was corrected as sounding wrong if I produced unvoiced obstruents intervocalically, for example. This is in contrast to what Dixon (1972:260ff) notes for Dyirbal, where both the voiceless and voiced allophone were accepted and said to sound natural.
1.4.1.2. Lenition
Intervocalic stops are often weakly lenited; that is, there is no clear closure in the spectrogram. Bowern, McDonough, and Kelliher (in press) describe this as a type of debuccalization; in this case, the stop closure is weakened, but the stop does not show the acoustic qualities of a fricative. There is minimal turbulence, for example and no fricative energy in the lenited stop. That is, the stop is leniting to a type of approximant or glide rather than to a fricative. This is illustrated in Figure 3.3, taken from Bowern, McDonough, and Kelliher (in press:Figure 2). Note the difference between the closure in the nasal and the lack of closure in the following stop.
The lenition produced allophonically is distinct from the phonologized and morphologized lenition which is a feature of Bardi nominal and verbal paradigms (see further §3.6.2 below). The outcome of morphologized lenition is a phonemic glide, which is quite distinct from the phonetic lenition discussed here.
1.4.1.3. Aspiration
The velar stop is sometimes voiceless and aspirated (that is, it is realized as [kh]). It appears to be a feature of men’s speech in particular (that is, recordings of men feature this more frequently than recordings of women do), although most speakers are recorded with this feature in at least some words. It is most common in the Coate recordings of Jawi. The aspiration appears to be conﬁned to initial and absolute word-ﬁnal position. It is possible that it is a careful speech phenomenon; it certainly appears to be more common in my wordlist elicitations and citation than in connected speech, though it is also found in some narrative recordings made by older men. Some of the

narrative texts could also be considered careful speech examples, however, since the speakers’ speech rates are slow, and phrases appear in some cases to have been planned quite carefully before being uttered. This is in keeping with views of narrative recordings as being important records of the language. Figure 3.4 shows an example.
Aklif did not ﬁnd this allophone in her recordings (Aklif 1993a):
Metcalfe (1971:88) posited a voiceless aspirated allophone for the velar stop phoneme before short and long low vowels, for example /gArA/ (i.e. gaarra,

80 Phonetics and Phonology
[C.B.]) ‘mother’s brother’ is realized as [khArA]. This was not borne out by my informants.
I did not ﬁnd the aspiration conﬁned to stops before low vowels, however. I have also recorded this allophone in words such as gooloo [khU:lU] ‘father’.

1.4.1.4. Laminalization
In the Jawi recordings, the palatal stop j /c/ is occasionally lamino-dental rather than lamino-palatal. Early recordings of place names provide evidence that this variation may be long-standing and may even represent a phoneme merger. On survey maps, the islands called Jayirri and Jalan are written ‘Tyra’ and ‘Tallon’ respectively. Moreover, a few words in Metcalfe (1975a) are recorded with initial d, but were rejected and given with initial j instead by my consultants. These included dool ∼ jool ‘kneel’.
1.4.1.5. Fortition or lenition following trills
In Bardi the sequence rrj alternates with rry in some words, particularly following a stressed syllable:

Consonants 81
(3.2) a. garrja /karca/ ∼ garrya /karja/ ‘sharp’ b. barrja /parca/ ∼ barrya /parja/ ‘saliva’ c. marrja /marca/ ∼ marrya /marja/ ‘smoke signal’
Not all words with the sequence rrj show this alternation. This includes rarrjin+ ‘shame’, which is never pronounced as *rarryin. Moreover, the variants are not equally distributed. For example, marrya ‘smoke signal’ is rather more common in the corpus than marrja is, but the reverse is true for barrja ‘saliva’.43 Therefore we could either assume that the forms underlyingly have a cluster rry which hardens to a stop, or that rry and rrj show overlapping allophonic realizations (that is, they are partially merging).44
1.4.2. Trills
There is also variation in the production of trills. The trill /rr/ is often realized as a tap intervocalically, though not by all speakers, and not in all environments. It does not occur initially. After the stressed syllable of a word, it is usually a short trill. This is also the pronunciation word-ﬁnally, where it is commonly devoiced. Before apical nasals, a trill is optionally realized as an apical stop d or tap [R]. This is particularly common in fast speech. The tap allophone of trills does not occur before nasals at other places of articulation. For example, rr+ng /rN/ clusters do not show the tap.
(3.3) a. irr [Ir] ‘they (3AUG)-ABS’ b. irrnim [Idn1m] ∼ [IRn1m] ‘they-ERG’
(3.4) angarramarra [aNaRamara] ‘we cooked it’
Palatalization of /rr/ occurs in palatal clusters; Yarrjarn (name of a spirit devil), for example, is pronounced [jærjé5ï].
There is some variation in the production of trill–obstruent clusters. One speaker (BE) tends to insert a schwa between the trill and the stop; that is, there is a micro-vowel which breaks up the cluster. The periodicity of trill vibrations can approximate that of the shortest vowels, and so what appear in spectrograms (and auditorially) to be inserted schwas could be simply the ﬁnal vibration in the trill. However, since this process is speaker-dependent, and since there are other processes of vowel deletion which are also potentially speaker dependent, I prefer to treat it as a real vowel.

82 Phonetics and Phonology
Finally, some of the oldest speakers do not produce a trill; instead, rr is often realized rather glide-like. That is, it merges partially with the glide /ô/. I take this to be a physiological effect of aging.
1.4.3. Palatals
Palatal consonants have a strong effect on a preceding vowel, particularly /a/. In such environments, /a/ is often fronted to [æ]; there is also frequently a noticeable offglide to the vowel. This can be seen in Figure 3.5, where there is clear formant spreading (raising of F2, lowering of F1) in the ﬁnal third of the vowel. Palatal consonants also have a degree of coarticulation with the following vowel; that is, there is often an onglide to a following vowel, though it is less noticeable than the offglide, such as that illustrated in Figure 3.5.

1.4.4. Laterals
One speaker (BE) tends to vocalize word-ﬁnal /l/; other speakers do not do this. However, there is a quality to ﬁnal laterals which make them sound rather retroﬂex. In careful speech word-ﬁnal retroﬂex and apical laterals are distinct; however, I suspect there is some velarization of the lateral, even among speakers who do not vocalize the consonant, which leads to a retroﬂex quality.

Consonants 83

1.4.5. Absent variation

It is worth noting that there are some crosslinguistically common phonetic processes which appear to be absent in Bardi. Apart from the morphological assimilation of /N/ in the past tense (for which see §3.6.3), nasals do not assimilate to the place of articulation of the following stop. For example, clusters of nyj (homorganic; IPA [ñc]) and nj (heterorganic; IPA [nc]) nasalstop clusters contrast both phonemically and phonetically:

(3.5) a. inyjoogoolij /iñcukulic/ ‘it broke’ b. injoogoolij /incukulic/ ‘he broke it’
(3.6) a. maanka /ma:nka/ ‘black’ b. maangga /ma:Nka/ ‘ochre’

Some Australian languages have prestopped allophones of nasals or later-

als (Hercus 1972). In Bardi, there is no regular prestopping. I have recorded

a few isolated tokens where a nasal following a stressed syllable was weakly

prestopped, but it is not a regular feature of the language.

Vowel-initial words occasionally begin with a glottal stop. (Most tokens of

this type were recorded from a single speaker.) More frequently, however, the

word begins with a voiceless vowel. Thus aamba ‘man’ in close transcription

is often pronounced a typical example of

aths e[˚5>w5morbd˚@o»]o, mwbitahrcnownistihdearnabinleitiianlitviaolicaenldesﬁsnpaolrdtieovnoiocfinthge;

vowel is given in Figure 3.6.

1.5. Variation in source transcription
Because there are so many diverse written sources for Bardi words spanning the last hundred years, it is possible to draw some conclusions regarding the segments that transcribers of the language have found particularly difﬁcult to hear. Retroﬂection is a consistent cause of difﬁculty. It is systematically overlooked in the early sources (e.g. Bird 1910, 1915). Intriguingly, Laves (working in the 1920s) tends to over-notate retroﬂection rather than undernotate it, especially around a and aa. It is unclear whether the early sources were able to discern differences in the rhotics. Later sources note them consistently, although sequences of r and rr in adjacent syllables are notated variably. Vowel length is also missing from the early sources and is inconsistent in Laves and

Metcalfe. Note that Laves had linguistic training (he was a student of Edward Sapir at the University of Chicago), but Bird did not.
There is some variation in whether ﬁnal vowels are transcribed. Nicolas tends to write them as schwa (implying perhaps that she considers schwa a distinct phoneme, since her transcription is otherwise phonemic). Aklif and Bowern write them as full vowels when present and omit them when absent. This is an area where there is considerable dialectal and speaker variation in the language; see §3.4.4 for more discussion. The notation of unstressed vowels varies a little, but is largely consistent among the recorders with linguistic training. There is some tendency among the untrained recorders to write such vowels as a, probably reﬂecting the English tendency to perceive unstressed vowels as schwa. Note that Figure 3.8b in §3.2.4.2 below shows that unstressed vowels are a little more centralized than stressed vowels, though nowhere near neutralized. This is in contrast to some Australian languages (such as Ngalakgan; see Baker 2008), where stressed vowels are more centralized than unstressed ones. There is some variation in whether a palatal or apical stop (/d/ ∼ /c/) appears in some words; see §3.1.4.1.4 for more information. I suspect that this is real allophony (or a sound change in progress) and not a misperception.

2. Vowels

2.1. Inventory

Bardi has seven vowel phonemes: there are three peripheral vowels (a, i, u), each contrasting in length, and a central rounded back vowel /o/. The inventory is given in Table 3.3 below. As previously, the table gives orthographic conventions. There is considerably allophony. Furthermore, consonant–vowel coarticulation leads to considerable variation phoneme realization.

[e]

o

a aa

Note that long and short u are both written as oo in the practical orthography. Some sources suggest that [e] is also a phoneme, though there are good reasons for excluding it, which are discussed below.

2.2. Minimal pairs
Table 3.4 gives some minimal and near-minimal pairs for Bardi vowels. In order to make clearer the phonemic distinction between /u/ and /uu/ (both written as <oo> in the community-approved orthography), I have used u and uu in the transcriptions in this table instead of oo to avoid ambiguity.

2.3. Status of mid vowels
The vowel o is an independent phoneme in Bardi, although in the other Nyulnyulan languages it is an allophone of u (cf. the minimal pairs in Table 3.4).
The status of the phoneme e, however, is more difﬁcult to determine. It is found in the word iigem, a type of plant, but this is a loan from Worrorra (where e is phonemic). Allophonically, it appears as the surface manifestation of a number of different underlying forms. It is the result of fronting of a before y; I have transcribed this often as [æ] but it is also realized as [E] on occasion. Some speakers realize /iya/ as a long close front vowel (it is

recorded as such both by me and occasionally in Nekes and Worms 1953). Also, ii is lowered to [e:] or [E:] before trills and retroﬂex consonants.

I was unable to elicit these pairs, however. The e sound in the ﬁrst vowel of liirramar ‘black cockatoo’ is expected if the underlying ﬁrst vowel is ii, as it would be lowered before the trill. The other words were not, in my recordings, produced with consistently different vowels; I could not reproduce the minimal pairs. I am satisﬁed that e can be regarded as an allophone of ii.45
2.4. Vowel realization and allophony
2.4.1. Canonical realizations
Since there is considerable consonant-vowel coarticulation, it makes limited sense to talk about ‘canonical’ realization of Bardi vowels. Figure 3.7 shows spectrograms of typical Bardi vowels in steady state and in initial (stressed) position, with formant tracks overlayed. There is, however, considerable variation in the realization of the vowels. The peripheral high vowels /i/ and /u/ (and their long counterparts) are somewhat lower than cardinal vowels 1 and 8 (that is, IPA [i] and [u]); they are closer to [ı] and [U]. The back, rounded, mid vowel o is fairly stable, and is closest to [O].
/i/ is a short, high, front, vowel. It is a little lower than cardinal vowel 1 in

88 Phonetics and Phonology
most contexts, and for most speakers. It is also diphthongized for some speakers, and is realized as [i@] or [I@] in such contexts. It is backed before [O] in contexts such as milon [m1lOn] ‘long ago’.
/i:/ is a long, high, front, vowel. It is a little higher than its short counterpart.
/a/ has considerable variation in realization, from [æ] to [6].
/a:/ is a long, low, somewhat back vowel, close to [A:].
/o/ is a mid, back, rounded vowel [O]. Some tokens of o overlap with u, especially when they are the result of vowel harmony (see below §3.7).
/u/ is most commonly realized as [U] or [o].
/u:/ is a long, high, back vowel. Its realization is closest to IPA [o:].
2.4.2. Allophonic variation
The placement of vowels varies considerably over the vowel space, as is expected for a language with a fairly small inventory. Figure 3.8a gives the average values for F1 against F2 for Bardi vowels (taken from Bowern, McDonough, and Kelliher (in press:ﬁg. 6)) in all contexts, while Figure 3.8b plots stressed vowels versus unstressed ones. The plots were compiled from approximately 500 tokens from one speaker’s (Jessie Sampi) reading of a prepared wordlist.
Bardi shows several other processes of allophony which are familiar from other languages. Short vowels are slightly lengthened under stress. Short vowels in initial syllables have an average length of 125ms (n=26) while short vowels in second syllables have an average length of 95ms (n=32).46
In unstressed syllables, vowels are somewhat centralized; this is also reﬂected in Figure 3.16, where the stressed vowels are more peripheral than the unstressed ones. The vowels /i/ and /a/ are neutralized to [@] or [3]. Round vowels are also lowered and centralized (and somewhat less rounded). They are not neutralized, however, as witnessed by minimal pairs such as ingirrij ‘they said it’ and ingarrij ‘they gave it (to someone)’. There are also realizations of short vowels in unstressed syllables which are unreduced.

Long vowels in unstressed syllables are shorter than they are when they occur in stressed ones. There is still a signiﬁcant difference between phonemically long and short vowels in unstressed syllables, however.
Before retroﬂex consonants and trills, high vowels are regularly lowered. The effect is particularly clear when the consonant closes the syllable, although it can also be observed in words such as moorrooloo ‘small’, where the vowel and trill are not tautosyllabic. Some examples with close transcription are given in (3.11).

(3.11)

a. moorrooloo ‘small’ ["mor8lU] b. moorrgool ‘work’ ["morkUl] c. wiirri ‘rib of human’ ["we:rI]

The vowel a is fronted considerably in the region of palatals (some discussion of prepalatalization was given in §3.1.4.3 above).

(3.12)

a. oorany [o:ræñ] ‘woman’ b. mayi [mæjI] ‘tucker (vegetable food)’ c. Gayginy [kægIñ] ‘Island near Sunday Island’

Finally, a is rounded and backed a little after w, although it does not fall together with o or u. Note that all words with initial w are loans, since ProtoNyulnyulan *wa- > a- in Bardi. Impressionistically, the rounding and backing in Bardi as much less pronounced than it is in some other Australian languages, such as Arabana (Hercus 1994) and Wati languages, but this has not been measured acoustically.

(3.13) a. wanggay ‘wattle sp.’ [w8Ngæj] b. wanggid ‘crow’ [w8NgIt]

2.4.3. Vowel length
Bardi has a length distinction for all vowels except o (that is, there is no phonemic ‘long o’ to match a : aa, i : ii, and u : uu). There are phonetic realizations of [o:] or [O], however these all appear to come either from sequences of owu or ow, or from lowering of uu.

Vowels 91
Long vowels are very rare outside initial syllables, although they do occur in some words.
(3.14) a. birrii /piri:/ ‘mother’ b. nalaarrad /nala:rat/ ‘turtle eggs’
Birrii ‘mother’ is from Proto-Western Nyulnyulan *birray or *birrayi, so although the word is phonetically realized as [bIrri:] it may be tempting to phonologize it as /birriyi/ . Such a solution is not available for words like nalaarrad, however, so I analyze all such words as containing long vowels. The rarity of non-initial ﬁnal vowels is probably related to a sound change which led to their shortening or deletion in most environments. To my knowledge, the only Nyulnyulan language which consistently preserves long vowels in this environment is Nimanburru (Bowern 2010a), but the materials for Nimanburru contain fewer than 500 lexical items, which makes systematic comparison difﬁcult.
2.4.4. Vowel reduction and deletion
Some speakers have full syncope in open medial syllables of trisyllabic words (especially when the second vowel is /i/ and the third syllable is heavy). The most frequent example in the corpus is the place name Ardinoogoon, which is often pronounced as Ardnoogoon [aãnUkUn]. This has been claimed to be non-existent in Australian languages (Blevins 2001b), and it is certainly rare, but Bardi does exhibit a case of it.
There is also vowel reduction in some other environments. One categorical environment is for high front vowels between a stop and the glide r to be rhoticized and reduced:
(3.15) birarr [pI~õ6r] ‘leave behind’ ˚
The vowel is still present, however, and it still bears stress; these are not consonant clusters.
A major part of Bardi morphology and prosody (and also of dialectal differences between Baard and Bardi) involves the deletion or non-deletion of ﬁnal vowels in morphological words. This is both a phonetic and a phonological process; furthermore, Bardi dialects differ as to the citation forms of many words and whether the ﬁnal vowel is present or absent. Speakers of the Western dialects usually omit them (though a copy vowel may reappear in some

92 Phonetics and Phonology
environments), while speakers of the Eastern and Island dialects and Jawi cite forms with the ﬁnal vowel. Final vowels are also present in the Laves materials in much higher frequency than in the modern materials, even in some words where both Eastern and Western dialect speakers have forms which end in a consonant. The ergative case marker, for example, is often given as -nim@ in Laves, especially in texts from speakers who identify as Jawi.
Phonetically, ﬁnal vowels are often partially or fully devoiced, even when they are present. One could see this as part of a more general process of devoicing in the language, which was discussed for consonants above in §3.1.4.1.1.
3. Orthographic conventions
The orthography in use here was approved at a community workshop at One Arm Point in 1990, following previous informal suggestions and trial materials at One Arm Point School. The principles of the orthography design included a wish to keep Bardi orthography as similar as possible to other Aboriginal languages of the Kimberley (particularly the Northern Kimberley region), and to make it as simple as possible for Bardi learners with English literacy to transfer those skills to reading Bardi. There was also a wish to make the orthography fairly phonemic, but to distinguish as many phonemes as possible in the system. It also had to be easy to type, without the use of special fonts.
The 1990 workshop did not make speciﬁc decisions beyond which letters to use in individual words; that is, they did not make rulings about further writing conventions (such as whether to use hyphens in writing clitics, or to write them as separate words), though in sentence punctuation it was assumed that English conventions would be followed. Some items were deliberately left underspeciﬁed so that the One Arm Point School program could experiment with different options.47
Punctuation is as for Australian English for comma placement, sentence punctuation, and capitalization. For example, proper names are capitalized, and direct speech is placed in quotation marks. In giving examples in the grammar, I have followed these conventions for the ﬁrst line of each example.
Clitics and afﬁxes are written with the preceding word. Morpheme and clitic boundaries are not usually written, though I have departed from this convention in the grammar in glossing example sentences (though not in the

Phonotactics 93
initial line of each example). In the School program, clitics are always written separately, and increasingly, case afﬁxes are also written as separate from the word to which they attach. I have written them together here, however, because it shows more clearly how different parts of a word inﬂuence each other (that is, it shows the morphophonological changes that occur within words, but not between words).
In general, surface morphological forms are written, not underlying forms. That is, if a consonant is deleted as part of a morphophonemic process, it is not written in the surface orthography. Vowel harmony is written; ﬁnal vowels are variably written depending on the source. The one exception to this is if two identical consonants occur across a clitic boundary (such as a verb form inﬂected with the middle perfect -ij, followed by a topic-marked direct object marker). In such a case, both js would be written, even though they are not both pronounced.
Reduplicated forms are not hyphenated. If a reduplicated form begins with an apical post-alveolvar consonant, the reduplicant is spelled the same way as the base. That is, the word for ‘pelican’ is written as lirlalirla, not lirlarlirla, even though the third lateral is retroﬂex and the word is pronounced /íIíaíIía/. English loan words are spelled in the Bardi orthography, except when they are examples of codeswitched (unassimilated) loans or personal names.
With respect to ﬁnal vowels, in texts I have transcribed them as present or absent according to what the speaker said. In citation forms I have usually included them in parentheses, and in the dictionary I have listed forms as variable if the word is recorded in the corpus both with and without a ﬁnal vowel. Some forms end in a consonant underlyingly, even in the vowel-ﬁnal dialects and Jawi, and some words do not seem to vary in my corpus and are consistently pronounced with a ﬁnal vowel. In this grammar, I have generally included citation forms with ﬁnal vowels. It should be understood that the Baard citation forms would not have these vowels.
4. Phonotactics
In this section I give an overview of distribution and frequency of phonemes in the lexicon. Counts of frequency were done on the Bardi dictionary as at January, 2012, and include head words and variant pronunciations. Counts are based on 5010 tokens. The counts are based on material which is transcribed in the practical orthography, and so differences between /u/ and /u:/

94 Phonetics and Phonology
are not recoverable using this data set. The other orthographic conﬂations (/nj/ vs. /ñ/ and /rt/ vs. /textrtailt/ are sufﬁciently rare within roots that overall relative frequencies are not affected. Claims about the phonotactics of the language are based on the same dataset.
4.1. Distribution of phonemes
Any consonant or vowel can appear word-ﬁnally in both surface and underlying forms. The frequent dropping of ﬁnal vowels creates many examples of surface ﬁnal consonants.
Several consonants cannot appear word-initially. No words begin with the trill rr /r/ or the palatal lateral ly /ń/. The restriction also holds for other Nyulnyulan languages. Unlike most other languages of the region, however, words in Western Nyulnyulan languages may begin with vowels, including in Bardi, where a historical sound change of loss of /w/ and /y/ word-initially has created many vowel-initial words. Words with these initial consonants do appear in the language, as a result of subsequent loans; however, they are quite rare.
There is complete phonemic neutralization of the apical-dental and apicalalveolar consonant series word-initially (that is, there is no distinction between d and rd, n and rn, etc.). The neutralization is in favor of the retroﬂex (apico-alveolar) series; thus words like daag+ ‘sleep’ are phonetically [úA:k]. The retroﬂection is particularly salient when the word is reduplicated (to daagadaag) and the d appears intervocalically. In the orthography, apical stops are written without the ‘initial’ r; thus the orthographic representation of /rdaagardaag/ /úa:kaúa:k/ is <daagadaag>. There seems to be more variability with initial apical nasals and laterals, where realizations of both [n] and [ï] (and [l] and [í]) have been recorded. Note that this neutralization is the opposite of what happens in other languages outside Australia (e.g. in Dravidian languages) where there is retroﬂex neutralization word initially but it is in the direction of the plain apical.
Verb roots, although they are not word-initial, show mostly the same distribution of initial consonants as morphological words do. That is, there are no verb roots which begin with rr or ly; there is, however, a retroﬂection difference in initial laterals; -rlabar- ‘kiss’ has a retroﬂex lateral, while -laba‘hold, possess’ has an apical one. There are no roots which begin with apical or retroﬂex stops d, rd or nasals n, rn, apart from one allomorph of the

Phonotactics 95
suppletive root -joo ‘do, say’, which has the form -di-. Only vowels can be syllable nuclei. Long vowels are rarely attested in
unstressed positions, and they are rarer than short vowels even under stress. There are no word-internal vowels in hiatus. When these arise through afﬁxation, a glide is inserted or one vowel deletes (see further below); the treatment depends on the type of afﬁx.
4.2. Phoneme frequency
4.2.1. Consonant frequencies
Table 3.5 shows the frequency of consonants in initial position, post-stress (C2) position, and C3 (the onset to the third syllable in the word). As can be seen, the distribution of consonants is not symmetrical, either within a given position or between positions. This is illustrated in the histogram in Figure 3.9.
The stops b, g, and j are considerably more frequent initially than they are in other places in the word. This is not surprising given that we can reconstruct a sound change where intervocalic stops either lenited to glides or disappeared completely, depending on the position in the word. What is surprising, however, is why in that case glides are not noticeably more frequent in C2 and C3 positions than other consonants. Another surprising pattern is that m is rather more frequent initially than in other positions; more so than other nasals. The ﬁgures of 0% for onsetless syllables in C2 and C3 reﬂect the fact that no vowels appear in hiatus.
Within manners of articulation, stops are highly asymmetric, with rd (the neutralized outcome of d and rd) being much rarer than other stops in initial position. Palatal nasals are also much rarer than other nasals. There are no striking asymmetries between C2 and C3, except that w is half as common in C3 position as it is in C2.
Frequencies of consonants clusters in Bardi are highly asymmetric; they are also very diverse. Figure 3.10 gives the frequency of consonant clusters, ordered from greatest to least. In order to enhance legibility of the table, clusters attested fewer than three times are omitted from the histogram. An additional 45 clusters were found either once or twice in the lexicon. Clusters as syllable contact possibilities are discussed in §3.4.3 below, where data from the full lexical dataset is taken into account.

4.2.2. Vowel frequencies
In contrast to the consonant frequencies, the frequencies of vowels are rather similar from position to position overall, with the exception of long vowels. That is, the frequency of a particular short vowel does not differ markedly from syllable to syllable. The overall counts are given in Table 3.6 and they are graphed in Figure 3.11. This histogram shows that a is rather more common than the other vowels, and there there is a strong asymmetry between short and long vowels. The long vowels bear a very low functional load in the language.
Although the overall distribution of vowels is quite similar from syllable to syllable, there are marked differences in the incidences of vowel transitions.

For example, when one considers the distribution of vowels in V2 position given the vowels in V1, there is a strong tendency for the V2 vowel to be identical to the V1 vowel. This is illustrated in Table 3.7, where the actual frequency of vowels in V1 and V2 position is presented as a ratio. Values greater than 1 (that is, where the number of observed tokens of a vowel in a particular position is greater than expected by the general distribution of vowels in the language) are given in bold.
Table 3.7 shows statistical support for vowel harmony in Bardi, even in words where vowel harmony has not been identiﬁed as a morphological process. In §3.7 I describe harmony processes involving morphological alter-

4.3. Clusters
There are no underlying word-initial clusters. There is a place name Blog, however this is in Mayala country and is almost certainly not a Bardi word in origin. No other Nyulnyulan language, with the possible exception of Warrwa, allows initial clusters (McGregor 1994b). The same is largely true for neighboring languages, although the one cluster typically allowed in Worrorra is br or bl (Clendon 2000).
Bardi allows an array of different consonant clusters across syllable boundaries; however, within a syllable coda, the only possibility is /l/, /õ/, or /r/ followed by a nasal which is homorganic with the following stop. These clusters are further discussed below. Example (3.16) gives the syllable template for Bardi.

Phonotactics 101
(3.16) (C) V (L) (C)
As Round (2009:107ff) and Hamilton (1996:182) have discussed, the contact possibilities across syllables in Australian languages are not always unproblematically captured using principles such as sonority sequencing. With a number of interesting exceptions, the possibilities for word-internal clusters in Bardi can be mostly described using the sonority hierarchy of Clements (1990). The same discussion applies to word-ﬁnal clusters as well, since all surface word-ﬁnal clusters are the result of ﬁnal vowel dropping and conform to the same considerations as word-internal clusters. Clusters across morpheme boundaries strictly follow the sonority hierarchy (with only one morphological exception). Clusters within roots show the same tendencies, although more clusters are allowed. However, sonority does not adequately capture all the interactions between consonants across syllables. Not only are there some exceptions, such as glide–stop clusters (which violate the sonority hierarchy); the place of articulation is also important in determining the licitness of consonant clusters.
In the post-stress (C2) position, clusters occur in one third (33.43%) of words in the dictionary. That number rises to 50% for the C3 position, but falls to 11% for the C4 position. Following C4, there are not enough tokens to get comparable ﬁgures.
4.3.1. Permissible clusters
Counts of attested clusters are given in Table 3.8. These are the clusters attested within roots in a count of the Bardi dictionary as at January, 2012. This shows that stops and peripheral nasals (m and ng) make up 95% of the second members of consonant clusters. Clusters with l, r, or n as the initial members account for 64% of the attested clusters in the data; with the palatal and velar nasals, this accounts for 79.25% of the data. Cluster distribution is thus very asymmetric in the language.48
There are several possible types of consonant clusters, both within words and word-ﬁnally (through ﬁnal vowel dropping). Sonority usually decreases between the coda of the syllable and the following onset. Figure 3.12 shows the sonority scale applicable to Bardi. For the placement of the trill, and its different behavior from the other rhotic, see McGregor (1988). L stands for the class of laterals, N for nasals and O for obstruents (stops). Discussion

here focuses on the well-attested clusters in the data; there are also a number of clusters which occur in single words. Many of these are loans or attested only in historically reduplicated forms where there is no unreduplicated form (for example, the only example of a cluster lny is in the word Nyoolnyool, the Bardi spelling of the name Nyulnyul).

Figure 3.12. Bardi sonority hierarchy ← more sonorous less sonorous → w, y r , L rr N O

These facts can be formalized using a version of the syllable contact law (Clendon 1988).49 Clusters with glides as a second member violate the syllable contact law; in other cases, there is plateauing or decreasing sonority between the ﬁrst and second members of the cluster. This is summarized in Figure 3.13. Here, L stands for laterals, N for nasals, and O for obstruents.

4.3.2. Triconsonantal clusters
Although the vast majority of clusters in Bardi occur with contact across a syllable boundary, there are clusters with l or rr as the ﬁrst member and a homorganic nasal-stop cluster as the second member. Nineteen of the examples are lngg clusters; there are also eight lmb clusters and ﬁve rrngg clusters. The examples of rngg clusters are variants of rrngg clusters (in, for example, ngoorrngganiimid ∼ ngoorngganiimid ‘knee cap’).
Such clusters raise questions regarding syllabiﬁcation. To treat the nasalstop cluster as tautosyllabic would introduce a highly restricted set of exceptions to the generalization that onsets must be simple. However, if the clusters are syllabiﬁed as lm.b or rrng.g, it would be odd if the only clusters underlyingly present in codas were of this shape.
4.3.3. Additional comments on clusters
There appears to be a difference in the spectrograms of /õ/, /t/, /õt/, and /ú/—that is, it appears that they all contrast phonemically, though it is impossible to ﬁnd near minimal pairs. There is a large drop in F3 for both /õt/ and /ú/. The main difference between the two, which one would of course expect, is the duration of the drop. For the cluster, the drop takes longer and the other acoustic correlates of a retroﬂex glide are visible in the spectrogram, such as loss of intensity in higher formants. Establishing this has been complicated, however, by speakers’ differing degrees of retroﬂection.
There are some gaps in possible consonant clusters and some exceptions to the sonority hierarchy. The clusters /ít/ or /íú/ are not attested in any words. Cognate words in other Nyulnyulan languages which show the cluster /ít/ have /rt/ in Bardi. Given the likely etymology of /ooldoobal/ /ultupal/ ‘things’ from */oolardabal/ ‘container-INDF’, we can see the outcome of /lú/ clusters (*-laú- > (*lú >) /lt/). The sequence /lt/ is rare, however, and attested in only eight words (compare /lp/ clusters, with 87 instances, or /lk/, with 104).
4.4. Final vowel deletion
Many of the Western Nyulnyulan languages show ﬁnal vowel deletion. In Nyulnyul, the ﬁnal vowel of words has been regularly lost, as illustrated

Phonotactics 105

in (3.17). In Bardi, however, the situation is much more complex, and this has considerable consequences for the synchronic analysis of word structure and the description of morphophonological processes. Vowel deletion involves a maze of dialectal, personal, stylistic, and transcription variation. Aklif (1994a:E0/9a) notes that ﬁnal vowels are especially likely to be deleted on trisyllabic (and longer) words, and only surface when a case marker follows. Disyllabic words typically retain their vowels unless they are preverbs. My data show other processes as well.

Gloss ‘man’ ‘boil’ ‘yellow ochre’

In order to understand Bardi vowel deletion, we must consider three distinct processes. First, there is a sound change in some Bardi dialects (but not others) which deletes many ﬁnal vowels. Secondly, there is some dialect mixing by individual speakers, which leads to words with deleted ﬁnal vowels appearing in contexts that might be unexpected through sound change. Thirdly, there are prosodic and sandhi rules for synchronic vowel deletion even in the dialects which do not have word-level vowel deletion as a sound change. Finally, speakers with dialect ﬁnal vowel deletion may also have a prosodic rule of vowel insertion.
Historically, the Mainland Eastern and Sunday Island dialects of Bardi retained ﬁnal vowels, while the Goolarrgoon (the north-eastern part of the Dampier Peninsula) and Pender Bay dialects (that is, the dialects closest to Nyulnyul) deleted them. This pattern holds in the Laves texts, for example, and in the Nyindinyindi materials recorded by Peile.
In the last half-century there has been a great deal of movement of people between dialect areas (as well as speakers of different dialects being moved together outside Bardi country) and this has resulted in many of the current speakers having a hybrid system. For example, Jessie Sampi, who married a man from Lombadina (in a ﬁnal-vowel-dropping area), gives the citation form of words with no ﬁnal vowel much more frequently than her sister, who spent more time with Sunday Island speakers and married a Jawi/Mayala man. Bessie Ejai, whose primary Bardi afﬁliation is with the Sunday Island area, also tends to use ﬁnal vowels in citation forms. All the speakers, however, also devoice ﬁnal vowels when they are present. The presence or absence of ﬁnal vowels thus varies greatly with the speaker. Forms with and

106 Phonetics and Phonology

without ﬁnal vowels are both considered correct Bardi by Bardi speakers and so are listed both ways in the Bardi dictionary (Aklif 1999).
Thirdly, there are prosodic and word sandhi factors which lead to vowel deletion. If a word ends in a vowel and the following vowel begins with with a vowel, the ﬁnal vowel is deleted. This occurs even in the speech of speakers with particular associations to Sunday Island and other non-dropping dialects. In (3.18), for example, both iil ‘dog’ and miidabaaw ‘boy’ appear without ﬁnal vowels (these words are also recorded as iila and miidabaawa respectively).

(3.18) Iil agal miidabaaw ingarrjarrala barda.
Iil agal miida-baaw i-ng-arr-jarrala barda. dog and male-child 3PST-AUG-run off

‘The dog and the boy ran off.’

(CB52.1/BE)

Whether a word ends in a vowel is also tied to syntax. There are a few morphemes of the shape -V, such as the predicative marker -a and the place location -i. These vowels are never subject to prosodic or dialect-based deletion.

(3.19) a. Jarr aamba boorrboorriida. Jarr aamba boorrboorr-iid-a. this man dance-EXP-PRED
‘This man’s a dancer.’; cf. boorrboorriidi ‘a dancer’ b. Boorrboorriidigija jarr aamba. Boorrboorr-iidi-gij-a jarr aamba. dance-EXP-VERY-PRED this man.
‘This man’s a really good dancer.’
(3.20) Jalan-i J.-LOC ‘at Jalan’

(Aklif 1994a:E0/11)

Constituency also affects the presence or absence of ﬁnal vowels. In (3.21), for example, there is a difference between the use of gorna and gorn (both ‘good’). In (3.21a) gorn is used in a complex predicate with the inﬂecting verb -ma- ‘make’; in (3.21b), however, gorna is a secondary predicate (‘make . . . good’).

(Aklif 1994a:E0/4)

A ﬁnal tendency we see in the Bardi data is the regularizing of ﬁnal vowels to an unetymological ﬁnal vowel. The ﬁnal vowel which is deleted is often the same as the penultimate vowel; cf. gajoord(oo) ‘ashes’, goonkoord(oo) ‘smoke’, bardag(a) ‘tree’, for example. Recall from Table 3.7 above that Bardi has a strong tendency to have identical vowels following one another. However there are many words where the deleted vowel is not predictable, such as ilngam(oo) ‘ﬁsh poison (Tephrosia sp.)’,50 ganban(i) ‘short oar’ and gambaj(oo) ‘woman whose child has died; bereaved mother’. Regularizing is probably found in anangarr(a) ‘pumpkin-headed ﬁsh’, which is cognate with Yawuru, Nyikina and Warrwa wanangarri ‘money, pebbles, stones’.51

Several descriptions of Australian languages have treated phonetic sequences of vowel + vowel as underlying vowel-glide-vowel sequences (see Round 2009:85ff for references and Dixon (1972) and Austin (1981) for examples from the Pama-Nyungan languages Dyirbal and Diyari respectively). McGregor (2006b:359) states that ‘in most Australian languages phonetic diphthongs such as these [i.e., ai or au: CB] can be accounted for as realizations of underlying VG or VGV sequences, where G is a glide (y or w).’ However, Round (2009) has shown that for Kayardild, there is a distinction between VV and VGV sequences. There is no reason why Australian languages should behave identically in this regard.52
In Bardi, the main interest here are the sequences ay(i) and aw(oo). Those of other potential vowels in hiatus, such as oowa or iya are not in doubt; there is a clear glide in most tokens. That is, are such sequences underlyingly ayi

108 Phonetics and Phonology
or ay (or awoo or aw or ai and au), or are all possibilities attested? We can divide the discussion into phonetic evidence and phonological evidence.
Phonetically, we would expect sequences of ayi and awoo to be longer than ay and aw (or ai and au); speciﬁcally, VGV sequences should all have roughly the same duration. This is not the case. As shown in Figure 3.14, putative ay sequences in words such as baybirr ‘behind’ are on average 100 ms shorter than awa sequences, and 150 ms shorter than aya sequences. Figures are based on 5 tokens per sequence from words spoken in isolation. Sequences of putative awC were not included here due to the difﬁculty of identifying sufﬁcient tokens.

A second piece of phonetic evidence comes from vowel fronting and coarticulation; in sequences of ayC, the vowel a is fronted and raised; this does not occur to the same extent for tokens of ayi. Compare the spectrogram of gayar-yoon ‘white.person-SOURCE’ (IPA [kajaõjUn]) in Figure 3.15a, where the ﬁrst vowel has steady formant readings at F1 8˚24, F2 1464 and F3 2540, with Figure 3.15b and the example of baybirr ‘behind’ ([pEjpir]), where there is a very small glide and the formants are steady at F1 572, F2˚2215, F3 2961. Both clips are from the same speaker, from words spoken in isolation.
There are also phonological reasons to treat the two sequences as distinct, although the evidence is not as clear-cut. The ﬁrst piece of evidence comes from ﬁnal vowel dropping. Words which would otherwise end in sequences of ayoo, awa, awoo, and the like, can undergo ﬁnal vowel dropping; this produces surface sequences such as baaw ‘boy’ and ngay ‘1MIN’. Secondly,

to vowel-ﬁnal stems. That is, they show lenition.

b. mooy(i) ‘darkness’, -goon locative: ‘in the morning’ mooyoon < mooyi-goon; not *mooygoon
c. birrii ‘mother’, -go ablative: ‘from mum’ birriiyo

The behavior of such roots stands in contrast to Nyikina, where there are glide-ﬁnal words (e.g. larrgidiy ‘boab tree’) which do take consonant-ﬁnal stem allomorphs of case morphemes. This might imply that glides in Bardi should be treated as vowels for the purposes of morphophonological rules. Alternatively, it could simply mean that glide-ﬁnal words take vocalic allomorphs; in YolNu languages such as Yan-nhaNu (BaymarrwaNa et al. 2005), for example, there is one set of allomorphs for nasal-ﬁnal stems, one for stop-ﬁnal ones, and lateral-, glide- and vowel-ﬁnal stems take a third set of (lenited) forms.
There is evidence from reduplication that ay sequences should be treated as a single syllable in words such as -jaybi- ‘ask’. Reduplication of disyllabic verb roots copies the vowel of the ﬁrst syllable and the second consonant (or cluster if one exists; thus -barndi- ‘cover’ reduplicated to -barnd-arnd-i-, and -jala- ‘see’ reduplicated to -jal-al-a- ‘stare’. Crucially, -jaybi- reduplicates to -jayb-ayb-i-; if the ay sequence were, in fact, ayi, we would expect the reduplicant to be *jay-ay-ibi-.
Thus in conclusion, ay and aw sequences are distinct from ayi and awoo sequences in Bardi on both phonetic and phonological grounds.

5. Stress
5.1. Primary stress
Bardi has a demarcative stress system. Primary stress is regular and appears consistently on the initial syllable of the word. All previous detailed analyses of Bardi stress have noted primary stress in this position. Stressed vowels are characterized phonetically by increased length compared to unstressed vowels; see Katsika (2008). There are also increases in intensity and, in some cases, pitch, likely related to the intonational system. Furthermore, unstressed

Stress 111
vowels are somewhat more centralized than stressed vowels. This is shown in Figure 3.16).

Stress is manifested as a combination of intensity (loudness), raised pitch and slight lengthening of the vowel. It is also characterized by shortening and some centralization of the vowel in the syllable following the stressed vowel, particularly when that syllable is open. Some of the early sources notated this quite consistently as vowel loss. Laves (n.d.:vol 10), for example, writes the bird name goorroodood(oo) as gurrdudu, with a cluster; cf. also Laves’ arrdil for arridil; cf. also irrgil(i) ‘boomerang, yellow hakea (Hakea arborescens)’, cognate with Jukun yirragulu ‘wattle (Acacia sp.)’. In my recordings, the vowel is still present, though quite short. When the second vowel of the word is o, however, vowel harmony results and the vowel does not reduce.
There are cases where the vowel of the following syllable is not neutralized, and there are examples in the corpus where the intensity peak does not coincide with the pitch peak. In such examples, the pitch peak is delayed into the second syllable of the word. The mismatch between intensity peak and pitch peak is subject to ongoing research. It is found sporadically in all speakers, and appears to be a result of interaction between prosodic phrasal intonation and word stress. Pitch peak delay has been noted in Kayardild by

112 Phonetics and Phonology
Round (2009), but not in the same environments as are found in Bardi. All phonological words receive a primary stress. This includes pronouns,
preverbs, adverbs, and non-clitic conjunctions. At the phrase level, word stress may be subordinated to intonational phrase level accent, where the ﬁrst content word of the phrase receives the pitch peak of the entire phrasal unit. Stress is also attracted to the ﬁrst syllable in loanwords, even when the English word would not have had stress in this position. The phrase ‘kerosene tin’, for example, is loaned into Bardi as a single word and pronounced "karcindin (Bardi spelling garrjindin). The phrase ‘old woman’ is borrowed with the stress pattern /"uluman/, even though the English phrase has the highest stress peak on the ﬁrst syllable of ‘woman’. Loan words with epenthetic vowels to break up initial clusters also receive a stress on that epenthetic vowel; goorrooj ‘cross’, for example, is pronounced ["kUrUc].

5.2. Secondary stress

While deﬁning primary stress is straightforward, the rules for secondary stress are complex. The rules for stress assignment are sensitive to morphological structure, prosodic vowel deletion, and syllable weight. A light syllable is an open syllable with a short vowel; syllables with codas and long vowels are heavy. With respect to morphology, there is a split between nouns and verbs: verbs receive a stress on the initial root syllable, while preﬁxed nouns do not receive a comparable root stress. Some morphemes with closed syllables receive stress: for instance the case markers such as the ergative -nim and allative -ngan and monosyllabic clitics such as the third person singular possessive marker =jin and the sentence connective =min, receive secondary stress; these are all heavy syllables. Agreement clitics carry stress; subject person agreement preﬁxes are stressed by virtue of occurring ﬁrst in the word; they thus automatically receive primary stress. Speakers seem to differ as to whether they produce consecutive underlyingly stressed syllables where clitics follow case markers; some stress both (as in 3.23a) while others stress only the last (as in 3.23b), or the ﬁrst (as in 3.23c).

‘his/her father [did something]’ c. "gooloo -­nim =jin
"gooloo -­nim =jin father -ERG =3MIN.POSS
‘his/her father [did something]’

For morphologically simple words, the generalizations are as follows. In disyllabic and underlyingly trisyllabic words, there is a single primary stress on the initial syllable. In trisyllabic words where a ﬁnal vowel has been deleted, there is secondary stress on the 3rd syllable. In tetrasyllabic words, the secondary stress is on the third syllable if the fourth is light and on the fourth if the fourth is heavy. These patterns are illustrated in (3.24) below.

(3.24)

a. gooloo ‘father’ /"ku:lu/ b. nimoonggoon ‘his knowledge’ /"nimuNkun/ c. i. milimili, milimil ‘paper’ /"mili­mili/ ["mili­mili] ∼ ["mili­mil]
ii. Galaloongoo (name of culture hero) /"kala­luNu/ ["kala­luNu] ∼ ["kala­luN]
iii. bilanggamarr ‘helicopter tree’ /"pilaNka­mar/

In (3.24b), nimoonggoon ‘knowledge’ has a single stress on the initial syllable; this word does not underlyingly end in a ﬁnal vowel. In contrast, words such as milimili ‘paper’, which are underlyingly four syllables in length, with an open ﬁnal syllable, receive a secondary stress on the third syllable; this stress remains when the ﬁnal vowel is deleted. Tetrasyllabic words with a heavy ﬁnal syllable, such as bilanggamarr ‘helicopter tree’, also receive a secondary stress on their ﬁnal syllable.
Subsequent secondary stresses are assigned in the same manner; on the ﬁnal syllable if heavy, or otherwise to the penult, and then alternating stress.

114 Phonetics and Phonology

There are no words longer than this which are underived; words with more than ﬁve syllables are either reduplicated or morphologically complex in other ways (exhibiting preﬁxes, sufﬁxes, and/or clitics). Reduplicated words show several reduplication patterns (see §3.8 for more details) but in terms of stress show the expected pattens based on the above generalizations. Reduplicated trisyllabic words usually reduplicate partially; however, a few show total reduplication. The words with total reduplication have secondary stress on the ﬁrst syllable of the reduplicand.

denia viridiﬂora)

As far as can be determined, secondary stress does not interact with lenition in underived words. While primary stress does interact with a number of phonological processes, including the results of lenition, the same does not appear to be true for secondary stress. The only interaction is the word-ﬁnal vowel loss described above.
Note that Bardi stress differs from Yawuru (Hosokawa 1991). For example, the weight of the initial syllable does not seem to affect the placement of secondary stress, though secondary stress itself is sensitive to syllable weight. In Yawuru, dimoraic initial syllables allow a secondary stress on the second syllable (i.e. the third mora) of the word:

(3.27) Yawuru /"wir.­kaôaNu/ ‘matches’

In Bardi, underived words with equivalent structure have secondary stress on their third syllable, not the second.

5.3. Stress assignment and morphology
The alternation pattern described above may be broken by morphologically assigned stress (i.e. verb roots and some afﬁxes and clitics with heavy syllables), sometimes resulting in stress clash as noted above. There also appears to be some speaker variation.53

Stress 115

5.3.1. Nominals

In compounds, the ﬁrst member of the compound receives primary stress and the second member receives a secondary stress on the root. Since there are not very many compounds, there are no examples of very long compounds.

(3.28)

a. jamoo-gamarda ["camu-­kamaúa] ‘mother’s parents; maternal grandparents’
b. aarlimay ["a:íi-­maj] ‘food’ c. birriigo˙oloo ["piri:-­ku:lu] ‘parents’

As in the case of underived forms, case-inﬂected disyllabic and underlyingly trisyllabic words receive a single stress, as shown in (3.29):

(3.29)

a. gaarragoon ["ka:ra-kun] ‘sea-LOC’ b. gooljoongan ["kulcu-Nan] ‘grass-ALL’ c. nidnga ["nit-Na] ‘net-INS’

A few trisyllabic words show variation in whether the sufﬁx receives a secondary stress or not.54 I do not currently have enough examples to tell whether this is the result of this afﬁx in particular, or of case-marked disyllabic words more generally.
(3.30) goolin-ko ‘sleep-ABL’ ["kulin­ko] ∼ ["kulinko]
For words which show vowel contraction, and which are underlyingly four syllables in length, there are two treatments. Some words vary as to whether they receive a ﬁnal secondary stress; many do, but it is absent from some tokens. For example, bilili-ng ‘leaf-INS’ is found in pronunciations of both ["pilil­iN] and ["pililiN] (that is, both with and without secondary stress).
Some words are recorded as not alternating, having a single primary stress and no secondary stress:

(3.31)

a. boolngoorroob ["pulNuru=b] ‘middle=REL’ b. bardogo ["paãoko] (< *bardaga-go) ‘tree-ABL’ c. ginyinggon ["kiñiNkon] (< *ginyinggi-goon) ‘then’

Disyllabic sufﬁxes and clitics receive a secondary stress on their initial syllable.

116 Phonetics and Phonology

(3.32) janamadan ["cana-­matan] ‘where-DIR’

If this word were underived, it would have the stress pattern *["canama­dan] (like [pilaNka­mar] ‘helicopter tree’ in (3.24b) above). This can be compared with (3.33), which has secondary stress on the ﬁnal syllable of the word (on the comitative case marker).

(3.33) a. irrjarinyarr ["ircaõi-­ñar] 3-COM b. barnamboo-nim ["païampu-­nim] ‘stingray-ERG’

For inﬂected nominals of more than three syllables, words which receive a secondary stress within the stem keep that stress, even if it leads to adjacent stressed syllables. In Bardi there is no general prohibition against stress clash.

(3.34)

a. Galaloongoonim ["kala­loongoo-­nim] ∼ ["kala­luN­nim] ‘GalaloongERG’ (culture hero name)
b. jarrgandinykoon ["carjan­diñ-­kun] ‘tree-cofﬁn-LOC’ c. yandilybarmarr ["jandiL­paõa-­mar] ‘boat-SEMB’

Where there is more than one sufﬁx, or a sufﬁx and a clitic, there seems to be some variation about how many secondary stresses occur. All can be stressed, or just the ﬁrst, or just the last.

(3.35) a. oorroolkoonjin ["urul­-kun=jin] ‘nail-LOC=3M.POSS b. booroojirronngan ["puõu-­cir-on-­Nan] ‘place-3A-LOC-ALL’

5.3.2. Verbs

As mentioned above, verbs (both monosyllabic and longer) mostly take a secondary stress on the ﬁrst syllable of their root. Note that this occurs even where this results in the assignment of secondary stress on a syllable adjacent to the primary stress, as in (3.36) below. Verbs with other preﬁx combinations have secondary stress on the root up to two syllables away from the primary stress.

(3.36)

a. Ingankanj. "i-­Nanka-n-j 3-speak-CONT-SIMUL

"ara "Na-­l-iña-n

"a:íi

NEG 1-IRR-catch-CONT ﬁsh

‘I didn’t catch a ﬁsh.’

There are two exceptions to this rule. The ﬁrst is the verb ‘give’, which has a phonologically null root.55 The secondary stress of inﬂected forms of
‘give’ falls on the tense marker, as in (3.37).

kalNa

"i-na-­kal=car­Nay

even.though 3-tr-[give]-REC.PST=1M.DO.TOP

‘. . . even though he gave it to me.’

The second exception is where the fully inﬂected verb is disyllabic. In such cases, there is no stress on the verb root (which is given in boldface):

(3.38)

a. Inman. "i-n-ma-n. 3-TR-put-CONT
‘He/she put it [somewhere].’ b. Injal.
"i-n-cal. 3-TR-see
‘He/she/it is looking (at it).’

There are rare examples where every syllable in the word has a stress. They tend to occur phrase ﬁnally.

‘He looks at them.’

118 Phonetics and Phonology

5.3.3. Agreement clitics

Agreement clitics may also take secondary stress, as shown in (3.40). It appears from the current data that clitics participate in the same rules for alternating secondary stress that case markers do; that is, while stress clashes are not ruled out and tokens with secondary stress on adjacent syllables are certainly produced, such stress sequences are dispreferred.

5.4. Stress in song poetry

A comment is warranted on word stress in song poetry. In many lines, word stress is subordinated to the rhythm of the accompaniment. Worms (1957:222) (a compilation of Bardi ilma and loodin song texts) also marks stress on the second syllable. An example is given in (3.41).56

Morphophonology: afﬁxal interaction 119
Stress shift delayed off the initial syllable is also found occasionally in storytelling. I have only noted this shift of stress in stories told by men. (e.g. D.W. ‘life on Sunday Island’, noted also by Aklif). Its use in narratives may mark a boundary in episodes in the story, since it mostly occurs on the last few words before a pause and shift in the action of the story.
6. Morphophonology: afﬁxal interaction
There are sufﬁcient regularities in Bardi afﬁxal interaction that much can be captured by generalizations based on lenition rules, sonority, and other phonetic-phonological motivations. However, there are sufﬁcient numbers of irregularities and exceptions in the system that a single set of rules across all domains is not possible without ad-hoc stipulations.
In Bardi verbs, the relationship between a surface form and an underlying form is not straightforward. Many of the preﬁxes are monosegmental and consonantal (compare the singular future transitive forms which contain -n-ngg-C). Underlying clusters of up to four consonants result from the concatenation of preﬁxes in underlying forms. These are not compatible with Bardi syllable structure, and the rules for parsing these preﬁxes interact with sonority and place of articulation constraints. Thus there is a great deal of allomorphy in verb paradigms if a morphological analysis is pursued. Moreover, the allomorphy rules are in some cases either arbitrary, or rely on phonological environments for allomorphy which do not have clear phonetic or phonological motivation.
An alternative approach would be to describe the preﬁxes paradigmatically. Appendix B gives the relevant paradigms for the inﬂecting verbs; however, many of the same alternations can be seen in nominal paradigms (both in the possessive preﬁxation and in sufﬁxation), though given the shape of the afﬁxes, the interactions are less complex. In this section I describe those alternations.
Many of the alternations presented here are the outcomes of sound change creating allomorphy. Lenition, for example, can be reconstructed with different outcomes in various environments, and since many afﬁxes appear in different lenition environments by virtue of appearing on stems of different shapes, they have several different forms in the language. There are other cases, however, where the most plausible synchronic phonological rule does not reﬂect sound change, even though the environment for the rule is phoneti-

120 Phonetics and Phonology
cally conditioned. For example, I do not reconstruct epenthesis as a historical sound change in Bardi, but it is the most parsimonious analysis of the synchronic state of the modern language. Comparative reconstruction using data from other languages shows this; see Bowern (2012) for discussion.

6.1. Geminate simpliﬁcation: Cα Cα → Cα

Clusters of identical consonants are simpliﬁed to a single consonant across a morpheme boundary. They are pronounced without lengthening. (Clusters of identical consonants never appear within roots.)

(3.42)

a. Ingalgan. i- ng- ngalga -n 3- pst- CRY -pst
‘He cried.’ b. aalin -nim
aalin -nim sea.eagle -ERG c. Gaaranim inambardijjarrngay. Gaara-nim i-n-am-bard-ij=jarrngay. sand-ERG 3-TR-PST-cover-MID.PFV=1MIN.DO
‘The sand covered me.’

Note that as a result of the change illustrated in example (3.42a), the present and past tenses of -ngalga- are homophonous. One is derived from i-ng-ngalgaand the other from i-ngalga-. There is no consensus on whether to show both consonants in the orthography. I write both consonants across clitic boundaries (as in (3.42c)) and where the sufﬁx does not otherwise alternate (e.g. (3.42b), where -nim is the usual surface form); elsewhere I write a single consonant.

6.2. Lenition
Obstruent-glide alternation is very common in Bardi. The minimal present tense of verbs and the minimal number of inalienably possessed nouns show intervocalic lenition as a synchronic process. Intervocalically a glide appears;

Morphophonology: afﬁxal interaction 121

however, when the stop is preceded by a trill (as in augmented forms), the stop appears.

(3.43)

a. ni-yambala ‘his foot’, cf. irr-jambala ‘their foot/feet’ b. i-yama ‘he is laughing’, cf. irr-gama ‘they are laughing’ c. i-wanyi ‘it’s ﬁnishing’, cf. irr-banyi ‘they are ﬁnishing’

In the cases above, b lenited to w and j and g lenited to y. This is the usual pattern in preﬁxes, though there is some inﬂuence of the surrounding vowels. If the vowel following the g is oo (IPA /u/), the lenition outcome is w:

(3.44)

a. i-woodala-n 3-get.lost-CONT ‘He’s (always) getting lost.’
b. i-ng-goodal-ij 3-PST-get.lost-PFV ‘He got lost.’

Lenition is also seen in case endings. The locative -goon has allomorphs -oon and -on, reﬂecting vowel harmony and the loss of the initial consonant of the sufﬁx when it is intervocalic. This is illustrated in (3.45).

(3.45)

a. ambooriny-goon ‘person-LOC’ > amboorinygoon b. goolboo-goon ‘rock-LOC’ > goolboon c. gaara-goon ‘sand-LOC’ > goron d. nimanyi-goon ‘throat-LOC > nimanyon

The case markers and noun and verb roots bring up our ﬁrst problem in lenition. The lenition product of g has several outcomes. In the verb and noun roots, it is regularly y, while in the sufﬁx, it is lost entirely; there is also a vowel change in (3.45c) and (3.45d). The lenition product of g in sufﬁxes is never y or w, though it is usually the outcome in the preﬁxes. The synchronic rules for obstruents are the same as the historical change in this case; obstruents in post-tonic syllables are lenited to glides, while later in the word they are deleted.57
Some alternations between consonantal and vocalic environments produce not deletion, but vowel alternations. For example, the proprietive derivational marker -goord(oo) has an allomorph -orda. Such forms are regular for stems

122 Phonetics and Phonology

which end in a; this is the result of a historical sound change where sequences of agoo and aboo were monophthongized to o. The sound change created two allomorphs of sufﬁxes which began with -goo:

(3.46) a. *CVC-goord > CVC-goord b. (*)CVCa-goord > CVC-ord

At some point this alternation was generalized to all stems ending in vowels, not just to ones ending in a, which would have been the domain for the original sound change. (Low vowels are about as frequent as the two high vowels combined, as seen from Table 3.6 above.)
A third lenition pattern is seen in some clitics, where the initial obstruent of the clitic is either present or absent, but no glides are formed and vowels in hiatus are resolved by deletion of the stem vowel. The clitic =(j)amb ‘thus’, for example, has two forms:

(3.47)

a. milon=jamb long.ago=THUS

b. ginyingi =jamb > ginyingg=amb 3MIN =THUS

c. gooyarra =barda > gooyarr=arda

two

=INTERROG

As will be seen in §14.6.2, clitic lenition is rather unlike the other lenition patterns discussed above. It applies only to clitics beginning with j and b58 and, moreover, is optional in some contexts. There is some indication that the presence of absence of lenition in the clitic =(j)angarr can signal a difference in meaning. Jessie Sampi, for example, gave example (3.48a), but then added that one could say (3.48b) if one were absolutely sure that the story was true:

(3.48)

a. Darrgalangarr jawal jarri.

Darrgal=angarr jawal jarri.

true=ONLY

story this

‘It’s a true story.’

b. Darrgaljangarr jawal jarri.

Darrgal=jangarr jawal jarri.

true=ONLY

story this

‘It’s a true story (I’m sure of it).’

(CB-FN3/67a)

Morphophonology: afﬁxal interaction 123
I do not have an explanation for such pairs at present. Jawi (but not Bardi) shows an additional lenition alternation. The velar
nasal lenites to zero intervocalically in non-post-stress positions; the resulting hiatus leads to vowel coalescence, with the vowel of the sufﬁx replacing the vowel of the stem.
(3.49) biili-ngan ‘cheeky-ALL’ > biil-an

6.3. Nasal assimilation

Velar nasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the following stop. Nasals at other places of articulation do not assimilate. This rule only applies to the past tense morpheme ng(a)- in minimal verb forms synchronically; however, there are no examples of clusters within roots with ng as the ﬁrst member, apart from those where a velar stop follows, implying that this alternation is the result of sound change.

(3.50)

a. i-n-ng-gama-gal ‘he was mocking him’ > inanggamagal b. i-n-ng-barra-gal ‘he was dreaming it’ > inambarragal c. i-ng-jarrala-gal ‘he was running’ > inyjarralagal

6.4. Nasal-stop dissimilation
There is an alternation between a nasal-stop cluster and a plain stop in some verb paradigms. We see in the forms in (3.51), for example, that the verb root appears as both -jimbi- and -jibi-.59
(3.51) a. inyjibina ‘he died’ b. ingirrjimbinana ‘they died’
There are also roots where dissimilation seems to have created morphological doublets, and some where the two forms are in free variation, with some speakers preferring one variant over the other.
(3.52) a. -bardi- ‘be covered’ b. -barndi- ‘cover’

124 Phonetics and Phonology
(3.53) nimoonggoon ∼ nimoogoon ‘she/he knows’ (lit. ‘her/his knowledge’)
Finally, we occasionally see such alternations in the future preﬁx ngg-. For example, the future form of the verb ‘sit down’ is recorded both as nganggalanda and as ngagalanda (the root is -galanda-):
(3.54) Underlying: nga- ngg- galanda -a 1- FUT- sit.down -FUT
In the form nganggalanda, the ﬁnal stop of the future preﬁx deletes since the verb root begins with an identical consonant (as per the geminate simpliﬁcation rule discussed in §3.6.1 above). In the form ngagalanda, in addition to the geminate simpliﬁcation, we also have nasal dissimilation; this thus deletes the entire preﬁx, but the absence of lenition in the root stop indicates that a preﬁx must have been deleted.
The origin of nasal dissimilation is probably a historical change, although the conditioning environment is difﬁcult to state. The change is most regular when the nasal appears in the coda of the second syllable, although there are exceptions. Two examples of overapplication of the rule are given in (3.55), and an underapplication in (3.56). In (3.55), we see the cluster simpliﬁcation even though there is no nasal in the preceding syllable; in (3.56), the rule does not apply, even though the conditioning environment is correct. I suspect that dialect mixing has obscured the proper restricted environment conditioning the change.
(3.55) a. *bardangka ‘tree’ > bardaga b. *karrambal ‘bird’ > garrabal
(3.56) *nundurr ‘sweat’ > noondoorr
This change appears to be spreading. In earlier recordings (before 2008) the past tense marker nasal in forms such as nga-ny-jarrmin ‘I got up’ was always present; it now seems to have been lost for some speakers, at least some of the time. This has resulted in the creation of a new paradigm where the present tense nga-yarrmi-n stands in opposition to nga-jarrm-in.
Such alternations have been noted in several other Australian languages; see Blevins (2001a:32), McConvell (1988) and Butcher (2006) for details.

Morphophonology: afﬁxal interaction 125
6.5. Apical dissimilation
Some Bardi speakers have a rule of apical dissimilation. That is, in sequences of apical + apical consonants in adjacent syllables (such as lVd, lVl, and lVn), the second apical is pronounced as retroﬂex. Speakers differ in how strong the retroﬂection is on the second apical; it ranges from quite strong to almost non-existent. The intervening vowel also appears to play a role, with retroﬂection being heavier (or at least more acoustically salient) when a low vowel intervenes. I thus treat the dissimilation as a phonetic rather than a phonological process.
6.6. Unsyllabiﬁable consonant clusters
Two types of unsyllabiﬁable clusters are created regularly across preﬁxal morpheme boundaries, where several single consonant preﬁxes are concatenated. The ﬁrst is those of two members where the second member of the cluster is more sonorous than the ﬁrst. The second is clusters of three or more members. Recall that there are very limited situations in which codas or onsets can be complex, and these involve sequences of l or rr plus a peripheral homorganic nasal-stop cluster.
The analysis of underlying clusters depends a great deal on how we analyze the form of the transitivity marker. Aklif (1993a) analyzes the transitivity marker as an invariant n-, which appears in two positions. Etymologically, the transitivity marker is n- in the minimal forms and a- in the augment forms, and appears after the augment marker. In the modern language, however, there is no way to tell that the augment transitivity marker is a-; it could just as well be n-, or any other segment which will trigger deletion of the initial consonant of the root. It is not clear what the best synchronic solution is; we can either assume a variant of the overt morpheme n-, which will always be deleted, or a vowel a-, which is the historically ‘correct’ morpheme but which is also always deleted. If we assume that the modern underlying form of the augment transitivity marker is a-, root obstruent deletion proceeds according to the historical rules given in §3.6.2 above—that is, post-tonic glide formation, and otherwise deletion in intervocalic environments. I assume here that the minimal form is n- and the augment form is a-.
Some examples with underlyingly unsyllabiﬁable clusters are given in (3.57).

126 Phonetics and Phonology

(3.57)

a. miliba mi- n- l- ibi -a 2- TR- IRR- drink -FUT ‘Might be you’ll drink it./ It’s possible that you’ll drink it.’
b. inambarrana i- n- ng- barra -na 3 TR- PST- dream -REM.PST ‘She/he dreamt it.’

We can go a long way towards describing the alternations in Bardi verb paradigms by proposing a rule that in disharmonic clusters the consonant of least sonority deletes. In the case of miliba (from underlying mi-n-l-ibi-a), the sequence n+l violates the syllable contact law (which states that sonority must decrease between a coda and following onset), and n is less sonorant than the l (recall the diagram in Figure 3.12). This rule correctly generates the forms in (3.57a), and in all the forms in Table B.1 and Table B.2 where there are two member clusters of unequal sonority. (3.58) shows the derivational steps required to parse the form miliba assuming underlying mi-n-l-ibi-a.
Such a rule also accounts for the present forms of the verb -rli- ‘eat’, and other lateral-initial roots. In these cases, the transitive marker n- would be adjacent to the initial consonant of the verb root, and in the same environment as the unsyllabiﬁable nl cluster described in (3.58). The present forms of ‘eat’ are ngarli, mirli, and irli for ﬁrst, second and third minimal respectively.

mi.li.ba

Now, consider cases where the cluster members have the same sonority (two nasals is by far the most common case). In some (but not all) of these

Morphophonology: afﬁxal interaction 127

cases we ﬁnd not deletion but epenthesis. A rule which says ‘delete the segment of least sonority’ fails in this case, as the sonority of the segments is equal. A rule of this type accounts for the forms of the transitive minimal past verbs beginning with b and g, as shown in (3.59). The correct formulation of the rule seems to be ‘when unsyllabiﬁable segments are equal in sonority, epenthesize.’

The epenthetic vowel is subject to vowel harmony, discussed below in §3.7. While an epenthesis rule accounts for verb roots beginning with b and g,
it does not apply to roots which begin with the palatal stop j, even though such roots are otherwise identical to those beginning with b or g. Verb forms beginning with j do not have the expected form inany- in the third person minimal past preﬁx bundle. Instead, they have in-; that is, their past form is identical to the present.

(3.60)

a. injalagal i- n- jala -gal 3- TR- see -REC.PST
b. * i- n- any- jala -gal 3- TR- PST- see -REC.PST
‘He/she saw it.’

A few solutions are possible. One would be to treat unsyllabiﬁable n+ny sequences as distinct from n+m or n+ng, though such a solution appears ad hoc. The facts in (3.60) would appear to be a case of a condition which can be described by the phonological environment of the rule, but where the rule is not itself phonologically conditioned. Alternatively, one could treat j-initial

128 Phonetics and Phonology

roots as a morphological class in which past preﬁxes are disallowed. I treat this as a morphological problem and give full paradigms in the interest of clarity for the reader.
Secondly, a general phonological rule of epenthesis in the case of sonority plateau is too strong, since nasal-nasal clusters are found in several forms. In the present of m- initial roots, for example, forms such as inman ‘he/she puts it [somewhere]’ are well formed. In fact, they contrast with past forms which show epenthesis; compare inamana ‘he/she put it [somewhere]’. Clusters of n-ng are also attested outside of the verb preﬁx system; in afﬁxation of the allative case -ngan, for example, there is no epenthesis (or deletion) with the allatives of n-ﬁnal roots.
One solution would be to assume that where coda velar nasals might occur, they assimilate to the place of articulation of the following consonant, but retain their nasality. This would lead to geminate clusters for nasal-initial roots, which would then simplify by the process described in §3.6.1 above. This is illustrated in (3.61) below:

(3.61) 1 2 3
→ 4 5 6

i-n-ng-ma-na ‘he/she put it’ > inamana

can’t syllabify; sonority deletion rule doesn’t apply [nasal]α place [nasal]β place → [nasal]a[nasal]
ﬁne ﬁne ﬁne post-lexical assimilation and geminate simpliﬁcation

This solution too, however, presents problems. Roots which begin with ny show a different pattern from other nasal-initial roots; like the roots beginning with the palatal stop j, they have the same form in present and past, with a nasal cluster and no epenthesis:

(3.62) innyan i-n-nya-n 3-TR-catch-CONT

‘She/he catches it.’ or ‘He/she caught it.’

There are two additional cases which do not ﬁt the rules described above.

Morphophonology: afﬁxal interaction 129

In the minimal number forms of verbs marked for irrealis mood, the distinction between transitive and intransitive is neutralized. For stop-initial roots, the initial consonant of the root deletes in both the transitive and intransitive forms. Deletion is regular in the transitive if we assume a rule of least sonority deletion, but there is no phonological motivation for the deletion in the intransitive. Examples are given in (3.63) below, using the root -gama‘laugh, mock’, which may take both transitive and intransitive preﬁx sets.60

(3.63)

oolama

a. u-

n- l- kama -a

3.FUT/IRR- TR- IRR- laugh -FUT

‘He might mock him.’

b. u-

l- kama -a

3.FUT/IRR- IRR- laugh -FUT

‘He might laugh.’

In (3.63a), the triple cluster is simpliﬁed by the deletion of the least sonorant member (g), but the remaining cluster is still unsyllabiﬁable and n+l is reduced to l. In (3.63b), however, lg is an acceptable cluster. The fact that deletion of g still occurs (despite no phonological motivation) must be by analogy to the transitive forms.
As a ﬁnal example, consider the verbs in (3.64):

(3.64)

a. inanggaman i- n- N- kama -n 3- tr- pst- MOCK -pst ‘He mocked him.’
b. oonkama u- n- Nk- kama 3.fut- tr- fut- MOCK
‘He will mock him.’

We seem here to have two treatments of the same sequence nNg—one morphemically n-N-g- and the other n-Ng-g-. I see of no way to capture the different behavior of these two sequences without the stipulation of allomorphy; that is, that the future morpheme has two allomorphs Ng ∼ g which vary according to transitivity.

130 Phonetics and Phonology
Thus in summary, while there is considerable phonological regularity to the Bardi preﬁx system, there are sufﬁcient irregularities that we cannot derive all forms without reference to paradigm forms.

6.7. Vowels in hiatus

Vowels can occur in hiatus in the underlying form, but not in the surface form in all but a few limited cases. Resolution of hiatus varies. In the situations where hiatus arises in verb preﬁxes, one vowel is always stressed and the unstressed vowel is deleted (which results in all cases in deletion of the rightmost vowel). The plural marker is arr-; in the present tense the vowel of the plural marker comes into hiatus with the vowel of the person marker.

(3.65) irrgama
i- ø- arr- gama 3- PRS- AUG- laugh

‘They laugh.’

In vowel-initial sufﬁxes, the vowel of the sufﬁx is retained and the stem vowel is deleted. This is true both for V-only sufﬁxes such as the predicative marker illustrated in (3.66a), and for longer sufﬁxes such as the middle perfect marker -ij.

(3.66)

a. boorrboorriida

boorrboorr -iidi -a

dance

-NOM.AG -PRED

‘dancer’ (predicate form)

b. inyjalgij

i- ng- jalgoo -ij 3- PST- fall -PFV

‘he/she/it fell.’

A different treatment of vowel hiatus is found in the possessive preﬁxes of nouns, however. In this case, the vowel of the preﬁx deletes, not the vowel of the stem. For example, given the third person minimal preﬁx ni- and the root alma ‘head’, the form ‘his/her head is nalma, not *nilma, which would be

Vowel harmony 131
expected if the rules for vowel deletion in nouns followed those of verbs. The generalization appears to be that stem vowels are deleted preferentially over afﬁx vowels; in the case of multiple preﬁxes or sufﬁxes, the vowel closest to the root deletes.
There are a few cases where hiatus is preserved, though these are very rare. One is the sufﬁx -injoon discussed in §5.1.7 below, which is usually -injoon without glide insertion.61 The word for a ‘pair’ of something is gooyarra-injoon, without resolution of the hiatus. Another class of exceptions come from certain collective compounds, such as marrga-irrgil ‘shieldboomerang’, where the vowel of the ﬁrst member of the compound does not delete (there are other words where the ﬁnal vowel of the ﬁrst word does delete). Thirdly, some monosyllabic verb roots exhibit glide insertion rather than vowel deletion; the future of the verb ‘hit’, for example, is oonkowa rather than the expected *oonka. Other roots show both forms. The future of the root -ga- ‘carry’, for example, has been recorded variously as oonkaa, oonka and oonkaya. I have no information about what governs the appearance of different allomorphs here. Not all speakers produced all forms, and in elicitation speakers only gave oonkaa as the future for ‘carry’. Aklif notes that oonkarliya ‘he/she will eat it’ (root -rli-) alternates with oonkarla, but speakers only give the former in elicitation.

7. Vowel harmony

Bardi shows vowel harmony in some afﬁxes. There are examples of both progressive (left-to-right) and regressive (right-to-left) harmony, though they occur in different domains. Harmony processes apply to a (both underlying and epenthetic) and are triggered by high vowels and o.
The vowel o is spread leftward over a. We see harmony both in case alternations and in verb paradigms. u (orthographic oo) is also lowered to o in the locative -goon when following low vowels. In these cases, harmony is controlled by the sufﬁx.62

(3.67)

a. alang ‘south’; olonggon ‘in the south’ (south-LOC). /alaN-kun/ /alaN-kon/ lowering /oloN-kon/ harmony

132 Phonetics and Phonology

b. balab(oo) ‘here, towards speaker’ bolobo ‘from here’ (here-ABL) palapu-ko palapo regular case/stem reduction polopo harmony

The rule for harmony can be stated as follows: (3.68) a > o / C* o

The rule applies iteratively but is blocked by a non-low vowel. Note that it applies to the ﬁrst person augmented subject agreement marker a-; for example, in o-rr-o-n=irr ‘we spear them’. The verb root here is o, the lenited form of -boo- ‘hit, pierce, strike, spear’. For the alternation, see §9.2.1.
High vowels are also spread leftward over a. This is found particularly in verb preﬁxes. In such cases, the vowel of the augment marker arr- and the vowel of the transitive marker a- are raised to i and oo (IPA /u/) depending on the following vowel. (3.69a) shows harmony across the augment preﬁx. (3.69b) illustrates harmony spreading from a sufﬁx (although harmony in this root is optional). In (3.69c) we see an example of the spreading of o affecting the person preﬁx, and (3.69d) provides an instance of the non-spreading of /u/ to the person marker.

(3.69)

a. i-ng-arr-a-ngoorribi-na ‘they chased him’ > ingoorroongoorribina
b. i-ng-arr-(a)-(ga)-ij ‘they carried it’ > ingarrij ∼ ingirrij c. a-ng-arr-o-na-n=irr ‘we speared them’ > ongorronananirr d. a-n-jool-ang-a ‘collect it! (imperative) *> *oonjoolanga

There are also some examples of rightward harmony, though these are rarer. They occur when the vowel of the root is a and the ﬁrst (stressed) vowel of the word is i or oo. As can be seen from the examples in (3.70), rightward high vowel harmony is sensitive to morphemic structure, and does not spread across verb roots.

(3.70)

a. oo-ngg-oorr-andoor-a 3-FUT-AUG-wade.across-FUT ‘He/she will wade across.’

Reduplication 133
b. Daab i-ng-irr-a-na climb 3-PST-AUG-TR-[carry]-PST ‘They climbed up.’
Rightward harmony controlled by the verb root is also found on some verb sufﬁxes. For example, the third person minimal remote past of the verb ‘do’ or ‘say’ is recorded variably as injoona and injoonoo, and the third person augment appears as both ingirrina and ingirrini. In the minimal number case, the unharmonized forms are considerably more frequent (544 vs. 382); in the augmented forms, however, the frequency is fairly equal (232 without harmony vs. 253 with harmony).
Some words do not undergo harmony, however. In some cases, we can point to dialectal variation as the cause of harmony non-application; the harmony rules are different in the Jawi texts recorded by Laves. The verb root -boo- ‘hit, poke’ does not trigger harmony in the epenthetic vowel which appears between the transitivity marker and the tense marker in singular verb preﬁxes ((3.71b)). In contexts where the root consonant lenites, the verb root appears as -o- (cf. oonkowa ‘he/she’ll poke it’); in such forms, harmony rules do still apply, however.
(3.71) a. nalma ‘(his) hand’; nalmanon ‘in his hand’ (*nolmonon) b. inamboogal ‘he poked it’ (*inoomboogal)
8. Reduplication
Verb roots, preverbs, adjectives, and some nouns may be reduplicated. Reduplication is not completely productive and some verb roots which might be expected to take reduplication are ungrammatical with it. In this section I survey the reduplication patterns found in Bardi and show that what appears to be inﬁxal reduplication can be shown to be the result of a historical sound change.
8.1. Monosyllabic words and roots
There are three patterns to monosyllabic reduplication. They are illustrated in Table 3.9 below. No monosyllabic inﬂecting verb roots admit reduplication in

134 Phonetics and Phonology

Bardi, although they do in some other Nyulnyulan languages, such as Nyikina (cf. Stokes 1982a:231).

Table 3.9. Monosyllabic verb reduplication

garr garrgarr/garragarr rub (pv)

come down

daab daabidaab doob dooboodoob(oo)

climb (pv) ﬂash (pv)

rarr rararr

noise of something creeping through the bush

The ﬁrst pattern instantiates straightforward ‘doubling’ of the word, such as garr > garrgarr ‘rub/keep on rubbing’. The second pattern results in trisyllabic outputs, illustrated by the words which have a link vowel between the base and the reduplicant. These words were probably historically disyllabic and the ‘link vowel’ (which is unpredictable) is just a stranded former part of the base. Recall from §3.4.4 that ﬁnal vowel loss is regular in several dialects of Bardi.

(3.72)

Unreduplicated Reduplicated

I *daabi

*daabidaabi

II daab

daabidaab

Some words have two patterns, either identity reduplication σ > σ σ , where the output is disyllabic, or a trisyllabic output with an epenthetic vowel between the base and the reduplicant. Garr ‘rub’, for example, can be reduplicated as garrgarr or as garragarr. In this case, however, the attested pattern does not conform to the sound changes we can reconstruct historically. For example, we would expect lenition to apply in the case of the trisyllabic output garragarr; garrarr would be the phonologically regular outcome. In these cases the reduplicated form may have been remodeled to preserve transparency between base and reduplicant; alternatively, the trisyllabic alternant may post-date the intervocalic obstruent lenition rule.
There are some reduplicants, however, that do show the expected sound changes. The form rararr, from rarr, for example, shows the expected outcome from *rarr-rarr.

Reduplication 135

8.2. Disyllabic roots

Disyllabic roots reduplicate fully if the ﬁrst consonant of the word is not an obstruent, or if the word is of the shape CVCVC. The root -marra- ‘cook’, for example, reduplicates to -marramarra-, where it means either ‘keep on cooking’ or ‘tempt (someone)’, and bawin ‘cut’ reduplicates to bawinbawin. These are illustrated in Table 3.10.

Table 3.10. Disyllabic reduplication patterns

amboonamboon bawinbawin birrjarrbirrjarr -linyjilinyji-marramarra-

together cut (pv) ﬂash of disturbed water (pv) wait for cook/tempt

Vowel-initial roots such as +alma ‘head’63 undergo vowel coalescence, as expected. Thus alma- alma regularly becomes almalma ‘attentiveness’.
Just as some monosyllabic reduplicated forms had three syllables rather than two, so too in disyllabic reduplication, some forms have an additional syllable, though these are rare. One of the stages of the arnkooy initiation ceremony, for example is called mayooloomayool.
The ﬁnal set of patterns is illustrated below in Table 3.11. In previous examples, the reduplicant has been preﬁxal. In these examples, however, the pattern appears inﬁxal, as though CVCCV reduplicates to C VCC VCCV.
This apparent pattern results from the historical sound change which lenited intervocalic *g, *j and *b (see §3.6.2 above). That is, we can reconstruct the reduplicants as *bardi-bardi and *janboo-janboo. In the case of *bardi-bardi-, lenition will regularly result in bardardi, the attested form. The same is true for *janboojanboo > janbanboo and many of the other cases listed in (3.10) above.64
In some cases, however, the result is not as expected. The reconstructed *gardigardi, for example, should give *gardiyardi, not the attested gardardi. We have two possible solutions here. One is vowel lowering; *gardigardi > *gardagardi, in which case gardardi is predicted. There are not enough tokens to establish or rule out such a sound change.65 The other (and not necessarily incompatible) solution is that a model for reduplication was established

on the basis of the regular examples (with deletion of the obstruent), and that model extended analogically to other roots in which deletion of the obstruent would not normally have occurred.
There are some examples of stop-cluster simpliﬁcation of inherently reduplicated roots. The form bilimbilingg ‘sunlight, sun’s rays’, for example, is clearly underlyingly a reduplicated form, though bilingg does not exist independently.

8.3. Trisyllabic and higher roots
Trisyllabic roots follow the same patterns as disyllabic ones, although the target of reduplication may be complicated by historical morpheme boundaries. This has produced a number of sub-patterns; which pattern a given root takes is not predictable from the modern grammar. Table 3.12 below gives illustrative forms.
For all the roots illustrated except -bilirri- ‘rock to and fro’, the reduplicant is disyllabic, the ﬁrst two syllables of the root. The sound changes delineated above for disyllabic roots have also occurred here, and they have obscured the reduplicant in some cases. That is, obstruent deletion has occurred, producing a pattern which appears inﬁxal when the initial consonant of the root is an obstruent. Compare the behavior of -ngoorribi- ‘chase’ and -bamarra‘shiver’.

Returning now to -bilirri- ‘rock to and fro’, on the basis of the reduplication pattern established above we would expect *-bililirri-, not the attested -bilirrilirri-. I have no explanation for the difference in pattern, or for why this root should have a trisyllabic base while the other roots show disyllabic reduplication. No other examples of root trisyllabic reduplication are attested in the corpus, although trisyllabic reduplication is attested in a few nominals.

8.4. Irregular reduplicants
While the discussion above accounts for almost all the data, there are three exceptions. Alongside the regular reduplicant of bawin ‘cut up aarli meat’, bawinbawin, there is also an irregular archaic form bawaninbawin. Secondly, there is a word boojamana ‘things, belongings’, which reduplicates to boojamanamana, with ﬁnal reduplication rather than initial reduplication (the expected form is *boojoojamana). Finally, jaala ‘spear’ can be used as a preverb with the light verb -ma- ‘put’, where the meaning is to string ﬁsh on a spear. The form of the reduplication is jaalajala, not *jaalala as would be expected by the above rules.66
9. Intonation
Evidence from intonation is used in a number of areas in the grammar in order to provide evidence for phrasal demarcation. Here I summarize the major patterns of intonation found in the data. The data should be treated with caution, however, since it has not been analyzed quantitatively. This section draws extensively on the sketch of Bardi intonation in Bowern, McDonough, and Kelliher (in press). Note that I have made no attempt to exhaustively annotate each extract, and only the main intonational points discussed here are marked. That is, this is not by any means an exhaustive study of Bardi intonation and the absence of discussion of any particular point should not be taken to imply its absence in the language.
9.1. Intonation in declarative sentences
In declarative sentences, the Bardi intonational system is demarcative, with a pitch peak (notated here as H*) aligned with the ﬁrst syllable of the ﬁrst word of the clause, and a fall to the end of the utterance. Alignment tends to be early in the utterance, with the peak early in the ﬁrst syllable of the word; it may, however, drift later in the ﬁrst syllable or even into the following syllable, though this is rare. Final topics receive a sharp fall which begins slightly higher than the pitch of the previous constituent. Figure 3.17a is an example of a typical declarative clause with initial pitch peak and falling intonation, while Figure 3.17b shows a slight H* spike on the place name Jarrinyan, near the end of the utterance.

When the ﬁrst word of the clause is a grammatical word rather than a content word, the pitch peak is realized on the ﬁrst content word of the clause. This is illustrated in Figure 3.18, where the ﬁrst word of the clause is the negation marker arra ‘not’. The initial reset mark (R%) indicates that the utterance begins near the top of the speaker’s pitch range.

The contours can stretch over quite long items with no pauses, and cover several syntactic units with little to no evidence of peaks and valleys. This is illustrated in Figure 3.19. The sudden apparent drops in the pitch track in Figure 3.19 (for example on the second word, aalga ‘day’) are errors in the pitch trace, due to the pitch trace algorithm halving or doubling the period of F0. This is a common error. The speaker (Nancy Isaac) has a great deal of vocal fry which may be interfering with the F0 extraction. The gaps in the pitch trace are due either to silence or to the absence of voicing, where F0 is undeﬁned. Two glosses in Figure 3.19 were omitted due to the inﬂexibility of Praat’s TextGrid spacing which led to them spilling onto adjacent annotations. They are i-ng-arr-a-na ‘bring’, which is 3-PST-AUG-bringREM.PST, and i-ny-jiidi-na-na=marra=b ‘go’, which is properly 3-PST-goCONT-REM.PST=SEMBL=REL.
Another narrative style, found particularly (although by no means exclusively) with older male speakers, involves very short intonational phrases and long pauses which may not coincide with noun phrases. An example is given in Figure 3.20a. I consider this a speech style rather than an example of speakers simply planning speech because all the male speakers who have been recorded (from the 1970s to 2003) use this style, while it occurs much

less frequently in the women’s recordings, and because the placement of the pauses implies to me that they are not associated purely with speech planning.
In this style, one ﬁnds quite long pauses which do not disrupt the overall intonation contour. Figure 3.20b is typical in that there is a long pause (of nearly 800 ms.) which occurs between the pronoun and the noun (which are part of the same noun phrase). A pause before the ﬁnal word of a clause is common, but pauses in other positions are also frequent. The pause before a ﬁnal word usually serves to mark a topic. The ﬁnal constituent may be either a single word or a phrase.
There is a deﬁned list intonation pattern, with lists of clauses having their own intonation contour. The ﬁnal verb in the sequence has falling intonation,

and frequently an initially lengthened vowel. This is the case of the ﬁnal verb in Figure 3.21, where the duration of the initial vowel of the ﬁnal word, ingarramarragal ‘they’d cook it’ is 159 m.sec, within the range of phonemic long vowels. Intermediate constituents have no fall on the ﬁnal syllable, as is also illustrated in Figure 3.21.
More than one item can be in focus in the same clause, in which case there are two main pitch peaks. An example of this is shown in Figure 3.22, where the initial constituent Joonggilbil has the typical pitch peak associated with initial position, but there is a second, larger peak on marrjayoon ‘smoke signal’. Impressionistically, items with this second intonation peak are always in ﬁnal position; that is, when there are two elements of focal information in

A salient feature of Bardi narration is a type of ‘terracing’ in intonational phrases. These melodies are characterized by a series of level high-toned phrases, interspersed with phrases with lower tone. This intonation pattern typically begins several clauses into narrative and may continue for quite some time in the story. This style of speech is particularly associated with female speakers. All the women who have been recorded have narratives which involve this style. More research is required to determine what types

144 Phonetics and Phonology
of boundaries are marked by the switch from high to low (and vice versa). A short example of this narrative type is given in Figure 3.23. These sequences have a ﬁnal sharp fall from the upper range at the end of the episode (also seen in the example in Figure 3.23, where the fall is on Jarrinyan).

9.2. Intonation in non-declarative contexts
Like declarative intonation, the intonation of content questions also begins with a H* tone on the initial item of the clause, which is usually the question word. Interrogative phrases have a rapid rise in pitch at the end of the phrase, as in Figure 3.24.
Polar questions with the interrogative marker nganyji have the same structure, as illustrated in Figure 3.25; the interrogative marker carries the ﬁrst H* tone and the ﬁnal word of the phrase has a rapid intonational rise. Finally, Figure 3.26 shows a single word clariﬁcation question, where the initial high and ﬁnal rise occur on the same word. This is the same pattern as the other interrogative melodies, realized over a single word rather than a multi-word clause.
Intonation in imperatives is still the subject of research. Many of the examples of morphological imperatives in narratives do not have intonation structures which are perceptibly different from declarative clauses; moreover, they are often embedded within larger narrative structures. Figure 3.27a, for exam-

ple, appears very similar, if not identical, to a declarative clause, with initial H* and fall to the end of the utterance. (The speaker of this example is David Wiggan.) An example of a more natural imperative intonation comes from Bessie Ejai’s telling of a story of the time when Kung-Fu Stumpagee rode a bicycle off the jetty on Sunday Island, the pitch track of which is illustrated in Figure 3.27b.
The imperative starts higher in the speaker’s pitch range than declarative phrases do, and may drop further; note that the track in Figure 3.27b stays

10. Loan phonology
This section describes loan adaptations between English, Kriol and Bardi. The Bardi dictionary is tagged for loans, where known, and currently contains about 100 examples. By far the largest number of these come from English or Kriol. There are also loans from other Aboriginal languages from the region, particularly in the area of material culture and ceremonial items.

10.1. English and Kriol loans
Speakers of Bardi have traditionally grown up in areas where English, rather than Kriol, was the major contact language (unlike, for example, Nyikina or the East Kimberley, where Kriol is dominant). However, it is impossible to tell in many cases whether the loan has come into Bardi directly from Standard English, or whether it is from Kriol (which has a lexicon predominantly with English source), or whether it is from an intermediate contact language, such as Aboriginal English. For most words the outcome in phonology would be identical. Some words are identiﬁed as coming from Kriol because of their

148 Phonetics and Phonology
semantics or morphology; for example, it is likely that boojoom ‘push ’im’ and loojim ‘pass away’ (< ‘lose ’im’) are from Kriol because of the presence of the characteristic Kriol transitivity marker ’im (for which see Koch 2000). However, using ’im is also a feature of broader Aboriginal English, including many of the older people at One Arm Point. Other words are more common in Kriol than in Standard English nowadays, such as pannikin, although they are likely to be fairly early loans and so may have entered from English.

10.1.1. Stress

English loans into Bardi have initial stress, whatever their stress in English. In this they conform to Bardi stress patterns (see §3.5). This is a feature of many words in Aboriginal English as well; compare ["bijain] for ‘behind’ (BOW-FN).
Some phrases have been reanalyzed as compounds and given initial stress. Thus:

(3.74)

a. oolooman ["Ul@m@n] ‘old woman’ b. garrjindin ["karcIndIn] ‘kerosene tin’ c. boolawayi ["pUl@waj] ‘pull away’ (single stress, no secondary
stress) d. dinamid ["tIn@mit] tin of meat e. doowalbaglag ["tuwelbaglak] twelve o’clock (no secondary stress)

10.1.2. Segment adaptation
In the earliest loans from English and Kriol, loans are fully adapted to Bardi phonology. Table 3.13 gives the mappings for consonants; Bardi is on the upper line, English on the lower. English phonemes in the same cell are mapped to the equivalent Bardi phoneme; for example, /tS/, /dZ/, /S/, /Z/, and sometimes /t/ are all mapped onto Bardi j.
English /s/, /S/, and optionally /t/ are realized as [c] or [J], as in bij ‘ﬁsh’, joobaga ‘tobacco’, and jooga ‘sugar’. Initial /s/ in clusters is dropped in older loans (e.g. boon ‘spoon’) or may be retained with an epenthetic schwa, as in jagool ["j@gul] ‘school’. School also appears as gool, showing the other loan treatment of initial /s/ in clusters.

English /t/ is sometimes phonologized as a trill, e.g. jarridi "jaRIdI ‘Saturday’. I assume this is because the /t/ is ﬂapped in this position, and one of the allophones of the trill in Bardi is a tap or ﬂap. While the English /r/ is usually reﬂected in Bardi as /õ/ ([õ] or [ô]), there are some loans that have a trill instead. One is gandoorrman, from ‘countryman’. Another is warrgam ‘work’; this word is widespread in Aboriginal languages, and perhaps implies that early English speakers in the area came from English dialects with rhotics in coda syllables (unlike Southern British English and unlike modern Standard Australian English). Other loans are r-less, however, such as boobala ‘poor fellow’ and alibala ‘early morning’ (lit. ‘early-fellow’).
Nasal-Stop clusters are frequently simpliﬁed; thus ["wInmal] for ‘windmill’ (although this loan might be from an English dialect where the d is not pronounced). Another example is ilaban ‘elephant’. Word-initial /h/ is practically always absent, especially in loans.67

10.1.3. Vowels
English vowels are borrowed as Bardi i, ii, o, a, aa and short oo. I have no examples of a long high back vowel in the loans in the dictionary.
The mapping for vowels is considerably less straightforward than it is for consonants. In general, high front vowels map to i, or very occasionally ii,

150 Phonetics and Phonology

high back vowels to oo (IPA /u/), mid back vowels to o, and the rest to a. Some tokens of /E/ become i in Bardi, however. Examples follow:

(3.75)

a. bagid ‘bucket’ b. gograj ‘cockroach’ c. awoojoo ‘house’ d. nid ‘net’ e. riiba ‘river’ f. binjil ‘pencil’ g. boolood ‘bullet’ h. booloo ‘ﬂu’ (inﬂuenza) i. gidil ‘kettle’ j. jaabi ‘sharp’ k. giliya ‘clear’ (giliyan inan ‘settle a score’)

A few words show paragogic vowels, though most do not. Those that do include jaabi ‘sharp’ and awoojoo ‘house’. Bagid ‘bucket’ also has a variant bagidi.

10.2. Loans from other languages
I do not have enough data on loans between Bardi and other Aboriginal languages to make any detailed comments at present. Loans in basic vocabulary are minimal (well under 10%; see Bowern et al. 2011). Loans in the region in other domains are more common, but most of the loans appear to be from Bardi into other languages in the region, rather than the reverse. I thus do not have enough tokens to provide generalizations about segment adaption in loans from other Aboriginal languages. I do not know, for example, how the long vowel phonemes in Worrorra which are not found in Bardi phonology are borrowed into Bardi. There are some differences in forms between loans and the donor language, such as Worrorra warlbirri inja ‘pubic covering for women’ (Clendon 2001:warlbirri), which is borrowed into Bardi as walbiri, but with a different rhotic.

Chapter 4 Word Classes, Wordhood, and the Lexicon
In this chapter I set out the evidence for the lexical classes of Bardi and provide discussion of word formation and word boundary types. Bardi word classes can be divided into those items that take inﬂection and those that do not. This is, in part, a division of convenience, since there is no behavior of inﬂecting words that unites them apart from their ability to take afﬁxes of different types. In comparison to the descriptions of some other Australian (and particularly non-Pama-Nyungan) languages, Bardi provides evidence for a relatively large number of word classes. Merlan (1994:57), for example, ﬁnds a small number of word classes in Wardaman; in Bardi we have evidence for a distinction between nouns and adjectives, and between adverbs (and adjectives) and preverbs.
1. Overview of word classes
Bardi has four major word classes, each with several subclasses. The four major classes are nominals, verb roots, preverbs and particles. These major classes are deﬁned on both distributional and morphological criteria, which are elaborated in the following sections; that is, they are deﬁned both on the basis of inﬂectional possibilities and of constituency (what other words they can combine with, and the syntax of that combination). Verb roots and particles are closed classes, while nouns and preverbs are open. Figure 4.1 gives a summary of the word classes and sub-classes. These classes are elaborated in the following sections, and form the basis for discussion of aspects of Bardi morphology and syntax in the proceeding chapters. All four of the primary word classes can be distinguished on distributional criteria and three of the four can be distinguished on inﬂectional criteria as well.68

2. Nominals
Nominals are subdivided into nouns, pronouns, and modiﬁers (including adjectives); furthermore, nouns can be divided into two classes: inalienably and alienably possessed. Inalienably possessed nouns are deﬁned by their obligatory co-occurrence with a preﬁx denoting the noun’s possessor. Note that the class of ‘inalienable’ items is rather broad, but does not deﬁne a particular semantic domain. For example, some body parts take the ‘inalienable’ marking, while others do not. Some inalienable items are also rather abstract, such as +moonggoon ‘knowledge’.
2.1. Nouns
Nouns in Bardi can appear as the subjects of transitive sentences (where they take ergative case marking and trigger verbal agreement). That is, nouns can be arguments of verbs, but verbs cannot appear as arguments of other verbs. Nouns can be replaced by pronouns, such as ginyinggi ‘he, she, it’ or irr ‘they’. Bardi nouns take case marking, but verbs cannot. Verbs are marked for tense and aspect, for the person and number of their subject (and object, if present), and for transitivity; noun roots take none of these afﬁxes. Nouns can be modiﬁed by derivational marking (whereas pronouns cannot). Nouns can take the predicative ending -a; other word classes do not receive this ending.
2.1.1. Alienability
A subset of Bardi nouns take preﬁxes for the person and number of their possessor; these are discussed further in §7.5. Nouns may be divided into alienably and inalienably possessed categories on the basis of their co-occurrence with a possessive preﬁx. Approximately 30 nouns (mostly body parts) take this preﬁx. Table 4.1 shows the nouns and their glosses. Note that almost all of these nouns can be reconstructed to Proto-Nyulnyulan with possessive

preﬁxation, and although only a small number of nouns take such marking in each Nyulnyulan language, the category is robust.
For the majority of words that take possessive preﬁxes, there is no possibility of using the word without it; however there are some exceptions, a few of which are listed in Table 4.2. These words appear both with and without an inalienable preﬁx, in distinct (though related) meanings. These forms are rare in Bardi and not found to my knowledge in the other languages in the family.

Doubled with the forms which show the alternation in Table 4.2 are forms with the inalienable possessive marker that do not contain any semantic notion of possession. A few forms are given in (4.1), where the ﬁrst meaning denotes an item which is inalienably possessed; the second is not possessed.

(4.1) a. nankarra ‘forehead; promontory’ b. niyalanga ‘tongue; ﬂame’ c. niya ‘back’; niyamarr ‘ridge of hill’

Some body parts seem to be able to take (at least historically) double marking of locative inﬂection; nalm-on-on ∼ nalmanon ‘on his/her/its head’ is one example. It is possible that some other words also take this inﬂection, but the forms are rare with anything other than body parts. They are discussed further in §5.4.2.1.
Inalienably possessed nouns cannot take the alienable possession marking; this is illustrated in (4.2) and (4.3). The former shows the lack of possibility of doubling the possessive nominal preﬁx with a possessive pronoun; (4.3) shows another example with a full sentence.

2.1.2. Proper nouns
There are proper (personal) names in Bardi, which, as far as can be determined, behave as nouns. As far as can be determined, names are their own closed set and not related to everyday common nouns. This is different from some other Australian language groups, where personal names are also words for plants or animals. Personal names appear to be seldom used as direct address terms, however, apart from in possessive constructions (such as naming a person’s ilma or song cycle; see further §2.9).69
2.1.3. Place names
Bardi has several different subtypes of nouns which mark location. The subtypes are associated with different morphological behavior. Place names (proper nouns) form their own class; in addition, we can recognize a larger class of location nouns which show some (but not all) of the same behavior as place names.
Place names have some peculiar syntax and morphology which sets them apart from other nouns. For example, only place names can take the locative -i. Examples are given in §5.4.9 and include Galan-i ‘at Galan’.
Location nouns and many place names are different from other inalienable nouns in that they take no locative marker -goon. These are fairly common, and include place names historically comprising the locative -goon and several other location nouns including morr ‘road’, boordan ‘thick scrub’, and biindan ‘open scrub’. Place names which do not historically include the locative case do tend to take locative inﬂection, however. This is further discussed in §5.4.2.
In (4.4), we see that ginyingg morr ‘this road’ denotes the location where the action of the clause takes place, although it is not marked with the locative case -goon. In (4.5) we see a similar example with a place name. (4.4) shows

Nominals 157

that the lack of case marking is a syntactic rule here and not a morphological requirement on these particular nouns, since we would expect any case marker to appear on ginyinggon in this phrase.

‘We have many ﬁsh at One Arm Point. They are good ﬁsh for eating.’

2.2. Pronouns
Pronouns are distinct from nouns in that they have different referential properties. Pronouns acquire their reference from context, whereas nouns do not. Personal pronouns are also morphologically distinct from nouns in that they have suppletive oblique forms (which can cliticize to nouns); nouns do not have a distinct oblique form.
There are three main types of pronouns in Bardi: personal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, which mark deixis and anaphora, and interrogative/indeﬁnite pronouns. There are also a few inalienably possessed nouns that are used as emphatic markers, which are discussed in §7.3. Personal pronouns are marked for number, whereas nouns do not take such marking (though neither do interrogative/indeﬁnite pronouns or demonstratives).
The case marking possibilities for demonstratives and pronouns are, as far as can be determined, identical to those for nouns. Thus the evidence that pronouns are a distinct word class from nouns is fairly slight. (Pronouns are discussed in detail in Chapter 7.)

158 Word Classes, Wordhood, and the Lexicon
2.3. Modiﬁers
Items can modify nouns in a phrase. Here adjectives, numerals, and quantiﬁers are grouped together as a single type of ‘modiﬁer’ (though with different subtypes based on morphology and preferences for order and discontinuity). Nouns can also behave as modiﬁers of other nouns.
There is a distinction in word class between nouns and adjectives in the language, although it is not very robust. That is, while we can deﬁne a syntactic position of ‘modiﬁer’, and group together several different types of words which may modify nouns, there is also evidence that modiﬁers such as adjectives do not form a single constituent type with nouns. While both nouns and adjectives may modify other nouns, only nouns can head phrases. Unlike in some languages, one cannot use an adjective without an accompanying nominal head unless context is previously established. One can omit the noun in context, but the context must be established. Thus (4.6b) is an acceptable paraphrase for (4.6a) in context, but (4.6b) is ungrammatical without a previously established referent of moorrooloo.
(4.6) a. moorrooloo baawa ‘little child’ b. moorrooloo ‘little <one>’
Another difference in the syntax of nouns and adjectives is also to be found in noun phrases. In a NP which contains an adjective, the nominal head can be elided and the modiﬁer used alone to refer to the whole phrase. This is only grammatical if the modiﬁer is an adjective. (4.7) is the parallel of (4.6) above and shows the situation with the adjective; moorrooloo ‘little’ may stand in context for moorrooloo baawa ‘little child’; the same is not true for (4.8). In (4.8) the modiﬁer of the noun baawa ‘child’ is aamba ‘man, male’, which is a noun. The phrase as a whole means ‘(the) male child’. Unlike in (4.7), however, one cannot elide the head of the NP and use the modiﬁer alone if the modiﬁer is a noun.
(4.7) moorrooloo baawa ‘little child’ > moorrooloo ‘the little one’
but (4.8) aamba baawa ‘male child’ *> aamba (intended) ‘the male one’
The order of elements is usually modiﬁer + head, although the alternative order is also sometimes found in narrative materials.

Preverbs 159
Numerals and quantiﬁers behave much like other modiﬁers, except that numerals can take some morphology that other modiﬁers cannot, and numerals and quantiﬁers are the only modiﬁers that occur easily separated from the rest of the noun phrase.
Further information about the morphology and syntax of modiﬁers can be found in Chapter 6 and §8.2.

3. Inﬂecting verb roots
Verb roots in Bardi are inﬂected for preﬁxes and sufﬁxes. There are about 230 verb roots in Bardi. Verb roots form a closed class (although a somewhat large one). For details and an overview of analyses of the morphology, see §9.1. Bardi verbs are easily recognizable because of their inﬂection; syntactically, a subset of verbs are also able to combine with preverbs (see following).

4. Preverbs

The Nyulnyulan languages have complex predicates, formed with an uninﬂecting preverb and an inﬂecting matrix verb, and Bardi is no exception. The syntax of preverbs and the identiﬁcation of complex predicates are discussed in detail in Chapter 13, so only brief comments will be made here, so that the class can be deﬁned, and so that readers can follow examples in the grammar.
Preverbs form their own word class on syntactic rather than inﬂectional grounds. Syntactically, they appear immediately before the inﬂecting root (and they must always appear in this position). Preverbs are the only element which can appear between the negative marker arra and the inﬂecting verb (see (4.9), where the preverb here is liyan ‘heart’).

(4.9) Arra liyan ngalama.
Arra liyan nga-la-ma. NEG heart 1-IRR-put

‘I don’t want to.’

(L56.10)

They take no inﬂectional morphology, and reduplication of preverbs gives an iterative or pluractional reading to the predicate (see §9.5); this distinguishes preverbs from other word classes. Preverbs are an open word class. English verbs, for example, are borrowed into Bardi as preverbs:

160 Word Classes, Wordhood, and the Lexicon

(4.10) a. warrkam -joo- ‘work’ b. gadigad -(i)nya- ‘cut’ (< ‘cut cut’)

Preverbs themselves have several different etymological and derivational sources in Bardi. Preverbs are the only word class for which members are frequently (if not productively) derived. (4.11) contains a list of the sources of preverbs.

(4.11)

a. nouns: (girringg ‘a cough’; girringg -ar- ‘to cough’) b. adjectives: (ngaada ‘short’; ngaada -joogooloo- ‘to break in half’) c. adverbs: (angan ‘close by’; angan -ganyi- ‘to come up close’) d. loans from other languages: (boojoom ‘push ’im’ (Kriol); boojoom
-ma- ‘to push off (a boat)’) e. words with no cognates in other word classes—function only as
preverbs: (marl -joo- ‘to stop’)

That is, the label ‘preverb’ could be said to refer to both a structural position in the verbal complex (see §9.1.1) and to a type of word which occupies that position.
In Bardi, preverbs cannot be used without an inﬂecting verb. This is different from some other North Australian languages such as Yawuru (Hosokawa 1991), or Wagiman (Wilson 1999). It differs from some other Nyulnyulan languages in this regard as well. McConvell and Bowern (2011a) and Bowern (in prep.a) provide some overview of complex predicate differences among northern Australian languages, and Bowern (2010b) discusses Bardi complex predicate syntax in particular in the context of Australian languages.

5. Other uninﬂecting words
The remaining word class, termed ‘particles’ here, comprises adverbs, conjunctions, interjections and the various ‘discourse particles’ that are a prominent feature of Bardi texts.70 Bardi has temporal, location, degree, attitude, and manner adverbs, amongst other items. Temporal and location adverbs tend to appear clause peripherally, although they do not have to. Manner adverbs tend to form complex predicates. The expression of adverbial meanings is split between adverbs proper and preverbs in complex predicate constructions. Most adverbs are morphologically simple, though there are derived words which have a similar function.

Wordhood 161
6. Wordhood
There are not the problems for deﬁning words that there are in some morphologically complex languages. e.g. Eskimo-Aleut languages (Woodbury 2002). There are clear phonological criteria, and several straightforward morphological criteria. The ‘word’ in Bardi can be deﬁned in different ways (with similar answers); here I consider phonological, morphological, and syntactic criteria for word status (following Bresnan and Mchombo (1993), Matsumoto (1996) and others).
6.1. Phonological criteria
Phonological words receive a single primary stress, which is consistently on the initial syllable of the word. There is thus a clear intonational demarcation of wordhood at the phonological level. Stress (including the markers of primary stress) is discussed in more detail in §3.5.1.
There are restrictions on consonant clusters which apply within words but not across word boundaries. There are no stop-lateral clusters within phonological words, for example. That is, there are no words with syllable contact of the form abla, but the sequence bl is licit across word boundaries.
Phonological words may not contain vowels in hiatus, either within a single syllable or across successive syllables. This is not a very useful test, however, because of the external sandhi and metrical rules which cause deletion of many word-ﬁnal vowels across word boundaries. That is, while these criteria deﬁne a possible phonological word and hiatus resolution rules apply obligatorily within a word, they also apply optionally to many sequences of words within a phrase.
Finally, there are certain morphophonological processes which apply solely within a word. There are lenition processes which apply to afﬁxes but not to clitic boundaries (some of these processes apply optionally to clitics) or between words. For example, stop-initial sufﬁxes such as the locative case marker -goon lenite when they are afﬁxed to a vowel-ﬁnal stem, whereas the clitic =gid never lenites. It should be noted, however, that there are exceptions to the lenition rules (both in that there are a few afﬁxes which do not lenite, and a few clitics which do lenite) and so this test is not as easy to apply consistently as the other tests for phonological wordhood.

162 Word Classes, Wordhood, and the Lexicon

6.2. Grammatical criteria

While a phonological word can only have one stress (and must have a single primary stress) and phonological criteria for wordhood are thus transparent, morphological criteria are less straightforward. Afﬁxal deﬁnitions of wordhood are dependent on the word class of the item. That is, different word classes have different afﬁxal structures, with nouns being, for the most part, limited to a single sufﬁx, while verbs have extensive afﬁxation on both sides of the root.
One criterion that appears to hold across word classes is that a morphological word is a host for a Wackernagel (second position) clitic. That is, Bardi clitics attach to morphological words and become part of the same phonological word. A sequential clausal clitic such as =min can attach to words of any class; (4.12) illustrates this with a noun, verb, and adverb.

(4.12)

a. Joorroomin ginyinggi Joorroo=min ginyinggi snake=THEN 3MIN
‘Then the snake. . . ’ b. Ingarralamankamin...
I-ng-arr-a-lamanka=min 3-PST-AUG-TR-hear=THEN
‘Then (s)he heard it. . . ’ c. Nyalamin arr injoonana...
Nyala=min arr i-n-joo-na-na here=THEN come 3-TR-do-CONT-REM.PST
‘Then (s)he was coming this way. . . ’

Such clitics mark the right edge of a phonological word. The left edge of a verb word is always marked by a subject agreement marker.
One of the criteria for wordhood given in Dixon and Aikhenvald (2003:24) is that a ‘word may constitute a complete utterance, all by itself.’ This definition would apply to Bardi words in all cases except for complex predicates, where speakers, though willing to identify the preverbal component of a complex predicate as distinct from the inﬂecting verb, say that it does not constitute a complete utterance; that is, the preverb on its own is not complete without an inﬂecting verb. This comment also applies to clitics, which

Word structure 163
are identiﬁed by speakers in isolation, but not felt to be full words. Note that Dixon and Aikhenvald (2003) argue against the representation of clitics as a distinct inﬂectional type in the syntax. Here I follow Zwicky (1985) and Anderson (2005:9ff.) in treating clitics as usefully distinct from ‘prosodically deﬁcient’ words.
7. Word structure
I use a morpheme-based theory of wordhood in this grammar. That is, I assume that form-meaning correspondences apply to levels smaller than the phonological word. Such assumptions are made, at least in part, for convenience of description. Given the number of lexical exceptions to the morphological rules proposed here, and given the complexity of interaction within afﬁxes and between afﬁxes and roots, some argument could be made for describing Bardi in terms of paradigmatic theories of word formation, or by using word formation rules rather than afﬁxes. In this grammar, where the interactions are complex, I have also given full paradigms, both as a guide to how the rules work and to help language learners. I also highlight areas where morphological representations are particularly interesting or problematic theoretically.
Bardi morphemes can be divided into roots, afﬁxes (preﬁxes and sufﬁxes), and clitics. Approximately 4,100 roots are recorded in the Bardi dictionary as at January, 2012. Bardi has both preﬁxes and sufﬁxes. Verbs take extensive preﬁxing, while a subset of nouns take a single preﬁx. Case marking is sufﬁxal, and there is also extensive verbal sufﬁxation. At points in the grammar I also make use the concept of a ‘stem,’ that is, a root with some afﬁxal marking.
Some have argued that clitics are not necessary in grammar. Dixon and Aikhenvald (2003), for example, describe clitics as simply a type of mismatch between phonological and grammatical word. Clitics can be usefully deﬁned in Bardi. They can be deﬁned phonologically by their different lenition patterns from afﬁxes; while afﬁxes have one lenition pattern, clitics have a different set of patterns (see §9.1.5 and §4.6.1). They can also be deﬁned by their scope; there are both clausal and phrasal clitics in Bardi. Clausal clitics appear on the ﬁrst word of the clause and join clauses to each other. More importantly, however, clitics are not just prosodically deﬁcient words; they are the only words in Bardi which must occur in a particular position in the

164 Word Classes, Wordhood, and the Lexicon
clause. Other ‘word’ order is much more ﬂexible. If clitics were simply words which were unable to stand alone, we would expect them to be able to join to any words which could act as a host.
Bardi shows two of Anderson’s (2005) clitic types: special and bound.71 Most clausal clitics are bound words; that is, they are always unaccented and are syntactically associated with a whole phrase. There are also special clitics; that is, clitics which are variants of free forms and which display a syntax different from that of the free forms. The object and oblique agreement markers are of this form, for example (see further §10.3), as are the clitic possessive pronouns.

8. Polysynthesis

Since Bardi has a great deal of morphology, it is worth considering whether Bardi shows aspects of polysynthesis in both the traditional sense and in the technical deﬁnition of Baker (1996) and other work. Baker (1996:488–489) describes the following criteria as being deﬁning of polysynthesis (properties which Bardi exhibits are in bold):72

(4.13)

a. syntactic noun incorporation (NI) b. obligatory object agreement c. free pro-drop d. free word order e. no NP reﬂexive f. no true quantiﬁers g. obligatory WH-movement h. N agrees with R arguments i. no true determiners j. N agrees with possessor k. restricted morphocausative l. NI or agreement in PP [no PPs] m. CP arguments only if nominal n. no inﬁnitives

Most importantly, Bardi lacks noun incorporation; thus it does not qualify to be called a polysynthetic language under traditional deﬁnitions. There is

Changing word class 165
some evidence that Proto-Nyulnyulan might have had noun incorporation; this was described in Bowern (2004a:Ch5). However, it is absent from the modern language. Thus though Bardi is morphologically complex, it is rather different from true polysynthetic languages such as Navajo.
Bardi has free argument omission (‘pro-drop’), free word order, obligatory agreement, and reﬂexive marking by morphology in the verb. In possession, the possessum can agree with the possessor (and the pronominal possessives are also marked for features of the possessum). The causative is also restricted. Bardi has no true prepositional phrases, so (4.13l) is not applicable.
More generally, however, Bardi does not provide evidence for a language in which all argument marking is contained in the verb. While there is a lot of evidence that Bardi’s ‘agreement’ markers can be the sole marking of arguments in the verb, and that they saturate argument-roles and thus fulﬁll many of the functions of pronominal argument markers, there is other evidence that the agreement markers are not behaving as one would expect in a typical pronominal argument language. There is evidence, for example, for an argument/adjunct distinction in free noun phrases (for which see §12.1); this is not expected if the true ‘arguments’ of the clause are the verb agreement markers. Bardi also has inﬁnitival forms (§11.3), that is, verbal forms which are non-ﬁnite but which nonetheless co-occur with free noun phrases. Finally, agreement in third person objects is sensitive to deﬁniteness; that is, the presence of agreement signals information other than the presence or absence of arguments of particular persons and numbers.
Therefore while there are some features of polysynthetic languages which Bardi shares, and many aspects of the pronominal argument hypothesis that Bardi supports, the analysis is not straightforward.
9. Changing word class
There is, on the whole, not much changing of word classes for roots in Bardi. That is, roots belong to one noun class and there is little derivational morphology which can change their word class. The one exception to this is preverbs, which may have sources in nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, as well as being underived. There are also cognates in Nyulnyulan languages which cross word class boundaries. There are, however, some frozen items which perhaps indicate that changing word class used to be more free than it is now.
There are also some alternations between verb roots and nominal roots

166 Word Classes, Wordhood, and the Lexicon

where one has extra, unidentiﬁable morphology. Some examples are given in (4.14). Witchetty grubs (Endoxyla leucomochla) are found in hollow logs, so a name etymologically related to a verb meaning ‘hollowed out’ and the denizen sufﬁx (see §5.5.2) is plausible.73

(4.14)

a. -galboo- ‘dig out, hollow out’; cf. galbajoon ‘witchetty grub’ b. -jinbinbin- ‘think of something’; cf. jinbinjin ‘clever, wise’ c. -loomoo- ‘crawl’; cf. loomi-(yoon) baawa ‘orphaned/neglected
child’

There are ways of deriving inchoatives and factitives from adjectives by using the adjective in a complex predicate. These are productive. Stative deadjectival predicates are formed by placing the adjective as a preverb and using the inﬂecting verb -ni- ‘sit, be at a place’. The inchoative is formed with the verb -joo- ‘do, say’. The causative is formed with the verb -ma- ‘put’. An example showing all of these is given in (4.15) below (Note that the alternation garrja ∼ garrya is regular.)

(4.15)

garrja ‘sharp’:

a. garrja jamooyoon ‘a sharp axe’

b. garrja -ni- ‘be sharp’:

Garrja i-ni-n ginyinggi jamooyoon. sharp 3-sit-CONT 3MIN knife

‘This knife’s sharp.’

c. garrja -joo- ‘get sharp’:

Garrja i-n-joo-na. sharp 3-TR-do/say-REM.PST

‘It got sharp.’

d. garrja -ma- ‘to sharpen something’:

Garrya nga-n-ka-ma jan

jamooyoon no˙orroo gadim

sharp 3-TR-FUT-put 1M.POSS knife

wood cut

nga-n-ka-ma=jan. 1-TR-FUT-put=1M.POSS

‘I’ll sharpen my knife and then I’ll cut my wood.’

Many nouns can be used as modiﬁers of other nouns without any overt derivational morphology. Some nouns, however, require an adnominal case

Changing word class 167

sufﬁx to function as a modiﬁer. In some cases, there are derived and underived pairs which have different meanings. This also applies to some attributive adjectives.

(4.16) (4.17) (4.18)

a. loomi baawa ‘an orphaned child’ b. loomiyoon baawa ‘a neglected child’ a. garnk(a) aarli ‘raw ﬁsh’ b. garnkagij aarli ‘ﬁsh that hasn’t been cooked properly’ a. miida baawa ‘male child’ b. i. aamba baawa ‘male child’
ii. aamba ‘a man’

A few adverbs are formed by the reduplication of nouns, though this is not a productive process. The word jaalany is a noun meaning ‘cliff’; when reduplicated, however, jaalanyjaalany means ‘along the cliffs’ or by extension, ‘along the outer edge of something.’

(4.19) Anjoola mayi jaalanyjaalany.

2-FUT-TR-collect-FUT vegetable.food along.the.edge

‘Pick the fruit from the outer branches.’

(MDict)

Finally, a few words can be used with zero derivation in more than one class. One such word is joornk(oo), which can be used as a noun (as in (4.20a)), a preverb (as in (4.20b)), or an adverb (as in (4.20c)). Such words are unusual, however.

The contribution to the lexicon by word class is given in Table 4.3. Counts were made from the Bardi dictionary ﬁle in January, 2012. Words are still being added sporadically to the dictionary as texts are processed but most of the new words are falling fairly equally into the categories of nouns and preverbs (that is, the two largest word classes).

Bardi word classes, as can be seen from Table 4.3, are very asymmetrical. Nouns account for almost 60% of the total number of roots in the lexicon, while preverbs and inﬂecting verb roots account for 20% and 6% respectively. Just over 350 adverbs are recorded in the corpus, which make it a fairly numerous word class (more so than inﬂecting verbs or adjectives); adjectives account for just under 5% of the total.

Chapter 5 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
This chapter is the ﬁrst of four which present the morphology and syntax of words in the nominal domain. This chapter discusses nouns, nominal derivational morphology, and case. Chapter 6 contains information about nominal modiﬁers: adjectives, quantiﬁers, and numerals. Chapter 7 discusses pronouns and demonstratives, while Chapter 8 analyzes the syntax of noun phrases and phrasal morphology and clitics not previously described elsewhere.
Bardi nominal morphology is almost entirely sufﬁxal. The only synchronically active preﬁxes in the nominal system are the possessor preﬁxes which occur on some body parts and other inalienably possessed nouns, which are discussed with pronominal morphology in §7.5.
Unlike some other non-Pama-Nyungan languages, nouns in Bardi do not receive or govern marking for semantic categories (cf. Harvey and Reid 1997). There is no gender marking and number marking is not productive, but rather appears to ﬁt the deﬁnition of a derivational marker. Nouns do not trigger agreement with other elements in the noun phrase. There is, however, a minor pseudo-classiﬁcation system (the term is due to Wilkins 1996) whereby generic and speciﬁc nouns combine in phrasal compounds. This is further discussed in §5.6.1.3. Animacy is not marked in the system but does play a role in forms of certain agreement markers, and in case frames. Deﬁniteness is not marked overtly, though there are quantiﬁcational clitics in the verb which provide information about the noun through cross-reference.
Bardi has both inﬂectional and derivational morphology. The derivational morphology is not productive and shows several highly idiosyncratic patterns and unexpected meaning changes. The major derivational sufﬁxes are given in §5.1.
Noun phrases inﬂect for case. Case is marked once in the phrase, on the ﬁrst word. There is no optional concord. In most of the languages—such as Djapu (Morphy 1983) or Gooniyandi (McGregor 1990)—which allow case to be marked solely on the initial element of the phrase, this pattern co-exists with full agreement; Bardi is quite different in this respect, in that marking on the initial element is the only way in which case is instantiated in the phrase. It does not co-exist with other patterns as a type of reduced marking.

170 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
This highly unusual pattern is shared by the other Nyulnyulan languages, along with Kuuk Thaayorre (Hall 1972), Anindilyakwa (Leeding 1989), and Bunuba (Rumsey 2000), but is not found, to my knowledge, in other parts of Australia or elsewhere.74 Chapter 8 provides more information about this and other syntactic topics.
Following Dench and Evans (1988), it is useful to distinguish between adnominal, relational and complementizing case functions in Bardi. That is, there are sufﬁxes which have the functional role of ‘case’ (Blake 1993) which are also used in other functions, not only to relate nouns to a predicate, but also to relate nouns to one another. However, Bardi also seems to admit an analysis of core and oblique case markers, as described in Andrews (2007), and that categorization is followed here for convenience.
Adnominal case functions mark complements of N or N . Many Australian languages have cases that appear only in this function, so it is useful to distinguish it from relational case marking, which provides information about the roles of arguments and adjuncts in the clause. Bardi has cases in both these functions. Complementizing case links clauses, and marks a secondary clause as an adjunct to the matrix clause.75 Complementizing case is found in Bardi, though much less commonly than in other Nyulnyulan languages such as Nyulnyul. Some Bardi cases can have all three functions, though typically they have only one or two (relational and adnominal). For example, the comitative case -nyarr has both an adnominal function (in phrases like ‘the man with a beard’) and a relational function (‘I went to the shop with my mother.’)
Nominal roots can be marked in three main ways. First, they can take a derivational marker (see §5.1). These derivational morphemes are all nonproductive and many have somewhat opaque semantic relations with their underived counterparts. Second, they can take a case marker. Nouns may take two case markers if the ﬁrst is adnominal in a derivational use; otherwise only a single case marker appears. Thirdly, they can take a possession marker (either a preﬁx or, in some cases, a sufﬁxed pronoun). A subset of nouns take a possessive preﬁx, and other nouns appear more commonly with a possessive sufﬁx. Possessive afﬁxation is described with pronominal marking in §7.5. In addition, nouns may host sentential and predicational clitics. This chapter describes the morphology of Bardi nouns, while Chapter 8 focuses on the syntax of noun phrases. Much of the morphological description of nouns also applies to pronouns; types of pronoun roots and free pronominal syntax is discussed in Chapter 7.

Derivational morphology 171
1. Derivational morphology
Bardi has little (if any) productive derivational morphology, and little involving a change of word class (see also §4.9 above). There is no multiple derivation; nouns can only take a single derivational sufﬁx.
By way of an introduction to the problem, consider the pairs of words given in (5.1) through (5.4):
(5.1) a. ardi ‘North(-East)’ b. ardiyan ‘North-East wind’
(5.2) a. oola ‘water’ b. oolal ‘watery stuff, melt-water’
(5.3) a. jalngg(a) ‘magic powers’ b. jalngganggoorroo ‘doctorman’
(5.4) a. goowidi ‘moon’ b. goowidany ‘by moonlight’
The formal and semantic relationship between the words is clear, yet with the possible exception of -al, none of the morphology appears frequently.76 We have a few indications that perhaps some of this morphology was once more productive. For example, garrgoyan ‘right there’ (related to garrgooy ‘completely’) is attested in the Laves corpus, but it is not accepted by modern speakers. In addition to the transparent cases exempliﬁed in (5.1), Bardi has additional derivational morphology which shows several highly idiosyncratic patterns and unexpected meaning changes. The derivational morphemes that can appear on Bardi nominals are given in Table 5.1. Not all items can appear on all subclasses of nominals; the distribution is discussed under the individual morpheme.
§5.1.1 gives information about number marking. §5.2 and following describes the major derivational morphemes and gives examples. Also included here are some sufﬁxes listed in Metcalfe (1975a) which are given there without example, and which I could not conﬁrm in the ﬁeld. One form requires comment: Metcalfe (1975a) has -ngoonjoon ‘only’ as a sufﬁx; I have this as a separate word, so it is discussed in §16.3.3. There are not very many examples where we disagree on the afﬁx status of items, though I make a more systematic distinction between afﬁxes and clitics than the other authors. See

1.1. Number marking

1.1.1. Number in the noun phrase

Bardi has no regular dual or plural afﬁxal marking on nominals. Number is cross-referenced on the verb or the predicate. If plurality is marked in the noun phrase, it is by the third person augmented pronoun irr ‘they’. In (5.5a) below, number is marked both on the verb (irlinirr ‘they eat them’) and in the object phrase loonggoord . . . irr aarli ‘blue tongue lizards’ meat’. In (5.5b) number is marked on the fronted predicate gornagijarr and with the pronoun irr.77

b. Gornagijarr irr baawa. Gorna=gij=arr irr baawa. good=VERY=3A 3A child

‘Those children are very good.’

(NI: CB/20 9:22)

The pronouns ginyinggi and irr are not solely number markers in such phrases; there are also deﬁniteness effects. These are described in §7.8.
Number marking of this kind is optional. In (5.6a), for example, the verb and the possessor complex are not marked for a plural object even though the sense shows that baawa ‘child/children’ is plural. It is non-speciﬁc, though, as is (5.6b), which provides a further example. Non-speciﬁc or non-individuated objects receive singular agreement in object position. (Contrasting examples were given in (5.5) above.)

Finally, the plurality of possessed items can be marked in the possessor head, as a sufﬁx to the possessive pronoun. (See §7.4 for discussion and paradigms.)

(NGJ:002)

1.1.2. Group terms

The only other marking of plurality outside of verbal marking is the ‘group’ marker -jin ∼ -in. Group marking is not productive in Bardi, and seems to be restricted to human terms. The words in (5.8) are those that can occur with the group marker -jin:

(5.8)

nyoongoorl ‘old person’, nyoongoorljin ‘group of old people’;

wangalangin ‘young man/men’

majoonggooloo ‘girl’, majoongoolin ‘young women’

Derivational morphology 175
waybalin ∼ waybalajin ‘white people’ (Metcalfe 1975b) gayarjin ‘white people’ (DW: POA)

1.1.3. Notional agreement

The marking of notional agreement for number has changed between the recording of the Laves texts and my ﬁeldwork. Numerals take plural agreement now; they regularly (although not exclusively) take singular agreement in the Laves corpus from the 1920s:

(5.9) Gooyarra agal gooyarra agal gooyarra agal gooyarra galgarriny inyjalgoon.

Gooyarra agal gooyarra agal gooyarra agal gooyarra

i-ny-jalgoo-n.

swim.breast.stroke 3M-PST-fall-CONT

‘Eight of them jumped swimming into the water.’ (Laves n.d.:103/13)

Note also that a few nouns, such as gaalwa ‘mangrove raft’, regularly take plural agreement in the Laves texts. Now they take singular agreement:

(5.10)

Ginyinggon gaalwa ingarrjagoolinajinirr gaalwa.

Ginyinggon gaalwa

then

raft

i-ng-arr-jagooli-na=jin=irr

gaalwa.

3-PST-AUG-break-REM.PST=3MIN.IO=3A.DO raft

‘Then their raft broke up.’

Sone nouns have default plural interpretation but can sometimes be singular. Ambooriny usually means ‘people’ and usually takes plural agreement, although there are cases in both the Laves texts and Metcalfe’s recordings where it is used to mean ‘a person’ or ‘some person’ (indeﬁnite, nonspeciﬁc) and takes singular agreement (for which see further §7.7).

(5.11) Ar amboorinynim injal. Ar ambooriny-nim i-n-jal. other person-ERG 3-TR-see

‘Another person saw him.’

‘[When] a person dies, they go to Looman.’

(L74.001)

There are a few other words with irregular plurals. Ara ‘other’ has a plural arang(a), which means either ‘others, the others’ or ‘some’. This sufﬁx is not found on any other word.

(5.13) Ingilirrmanajirr aranga.

aranga.

3-PST-call.out-REM.PST=3A.IO others

‘He sang out to the others.’

(L53.004)

The word iinalang ‘island’ has the plural iniinalang ‘islands’; to my knowledge it is the only noun that reduplicates to form a plural in this way. Bernard Comrie (pers. comm.) suggests that the reduplication might signal a collective reading (closer to English ‘archipelago’). Some examples do suggest a collective reading, such as (5.14a); however, (5.14b) provides a counter-example, where iniinalang receives plural cross-referencing on the verb (and is also modiﬁed by boonyja ‘all, every’), implying that iniinalang is not a true collective.

3-PST-share-CONT

‘This man [Galaloong] visited all the islands, he gave food to all

the islands, he shared it.’

(GAL3.008)

There are other rare instances of nominal reduplication attested in the corpus, but in each case, the reduplication derives an adverb from the noun; for example, the reduplicated form of bardag ‘tree’, bardagardag, means ‘tree by tree’ (e.g. describing the way in which someone who is stalking a hunter might approach his target).

1.2. ‘Indeﬁnite’: -al

There is a marker of indeﬁniteness of the form -al which appears to be derivational; it is rare, though there are a few examples in Metcalfe (1975a). It occurs in words such as ool-al ‘watery stuff’ (cf. oola ‘water’). It is recognized by speakers but not used much. It marks items as being associated in some indeﬁnite way with the head noun. The only spontaneous use in a sentence which I have recorded is given in (5.15), where -al is attaching to the oblique clitic =jirr ‘their’.

(5.15) Niimana iila nganjaljirr manyjaljirral.
Niimana iila nga-n-jal=jirr manyjal=jirr-al. many dog 1-TR-see-3A.IO hungry=3A.IO-INDEF

‘I see many hungry dogs.’

(BOW-FN3/46)

There is another use of a form -al, which is recorded only in the Metcalfe corpus. It is translated as though it has a contrastive use; the example from Metcalfe (1975a) is given in (5.16).

(5.16) Rayal irr gardinon.

178 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
This seems to be old Bardi. It is not used these days. It is not certain that this use of -al is the same sufﬁx as the indeﬁnite one.
1.3. ‘Expert’: -iid(i)
The sufﬁx -iidi is added to nouns and is used to denote people who have the noun as a major characteristic. Thus ilmiidi is ‘someone who is associated with ilma, someone who is an expert at ilma (public songs).’
The expert sufﬁx can only appear on nouns, though it can appear on process-like nouns like laanybi ‘thieving’.78 It is ungrammatical on adjectives such as gorna ‘good’. Table 5.2 gives the -iidi words recorded in the corpus.
(5.17) * gorn-iidi ‘a good man, an expert in goodness’
Although this sufﬁx is the most common of the Bardi derivational morphemes, it is not productive in current Bardi; ilmiidi, for example, is accepted, but *loodiniidi was rejected by BE and NI.79 Inbaliidi was ungrammatical (inbal is a type of song style), but mangaliidi (a different type of song) was grammatical. However, there is some evidence that the sufﬁx used to be more productive, and could be used to derive words for new items; cf. baarliidi ‘bank manager’, which was recorded by Metcalfe (1975a).80
The sufﬁx can also be used on some gerunds, but not all of them; for example, mayarginiid ‘frightened person’ (cf. -jargi- ‘be scared’) was accepted, but *mamarraniid ‘cook, someone who cooks’ was not. I could ﬁnd no systematic pattern as to which forms were allowed and which were not; it was not based on transitivity, grammatical relations, or any other obvious way of classifying verb roots.
A few words for ﬂowers also appear to contain this sufﬁx, although the vowel is recorded as short:
(5.18) a. ganboorridi ‘paperbark tree ﬂowers’ (cf. ganboorr ‘paperbark (Melaleuca spp.)’)
b. gaardgidi ‘bloodwood tree ﬂowers’ (cf. gaardga ‘bloodwood’)

180 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

1.4. ‘Good for, pertaining to’: -ngiid

In addition to the ‘expert’ sufﬁx, there is a derivational marker of the form -ngiid or -ngiidi which means ‘good for’ or ‘pertaining to’; that is, the afﬁxed noun is something that pertains to, is appropriate for, or good for something.

(5.19) Goolay jabijabingiid. Goolay jabijabi-ngiid. cocky.apple itching-ABOUT
‘Cocky apple tree is good for itches.’

It is not commonly used, but there are some examples in Metcalfe’s dic-

‘What do you need food for?’

(L158.007)

Laves writes the form in the text as two words, but he has a note at this point in the text of further examples of the sufﬁx, including the forms aarlimay-ngiidi ‘food-ABOUT’, goorlilngiid ‘turtle-ABOUT’, and jo˙orroongiid ‘snake-ABOUT’, where the items are written as a single word.

1.5. ‘Privative’: -(g)arda
The privative sufﬁx is used to denote someone or something ‘without X.’ Although many authors (such as Hercus 1994) call the privative a case because it patterns with the other adnominal cases in languages such as Arabana, I have included it in the derivational morphology for Bardi because it seems very unproductive, and could not be said to function as a real adnominal case. The productive functions of marking of lacking are taken in Bardi by the ‘adverb’ arrajina/arrijina ‘without’ (for which see §15.3.4.1); the adverb which is a better correspondent of the item that patterns as a case in some other languages. (5.21) provides examples.

This sufﬁx was not used by my consultants and all examples are recorded from Metcalfe (1975a) and Metcalfe (1975b). There are also sentential clitics =(b)ard and =(g)ard, but they have a different function; however, because of the initial consonant dropping of these clitics, they appear identical in for many words.

1.6. Qualitative, ‘having’, proprietive: -goord(oo)

The sufﬁx in Bardi is -goordoo after consonants and -orda after vowels. The vowel of the stem is deleted before the vowel of the sufﬁx. The proprietive forms adjectives from nouns In (5.23), for example, Jimijanyji is walking around looking for a tree ‘with a hollow’ (galandarrgoordoo bardaga) to put a corpse in:

Like many of the derivational and case sufﬁxes to be discussed in this chapter, there are some forms which fail to show the expected lenition and must be lexically speciﬁed. The word nyirroogoordoo ‘how’, for example, ends in a vowel, but does not show the expected form *nyirrordoo.
Bardi’s -goordoo is etymologically related to the comitative case in Nyikina and the other Eastern Nyulnyulan languages, i.e. -goordany. It shows the regular loss of ﬁnal *-ny.82

(5.26) Nyikina
Gunydyu-gudany yi-nga-n. secret-HAVING 3SG(II)-sit-PRS

‘He’s keeping it a secret.’

(Stokes 1982a:108, ex 188 (SN))

The sufﬁx is not very productive, and these days the comitative -nyarr (see §5.5.1) also functions as the regular proprietive; -nyarr is a case marker and thus ﬁts the deﬁnition of an adnominal marker.
In Nyulnyul, the cognate proprietive sufﬁx is said to have an impermanent quality to it (McGregor in press). That is, it is used of items where the proprietive marked attribute does not denote a permanent characteristic. It is hard to argue for that reading in Bardi, though; it appears to be a neutral sufﬁx. For example, a form such as diyilgoorda ‘hole-PROP’ was glossed in Bardi as riiwa ilaban ‘it’s got holes’. It is used to describe a reef or piece of coral, where the holes are permanent. Another example, diyildiyilorda ‘spotted’, was used of freckles, or spots on the fur of a dog, both of which are permanent.

1.7. ‘Together’: -injoon(a)

There is a sufﬁx of the form -injoon, -injoonoo, or -injoona, which occurs a number of times in the older sources. It is rather unclear what it means; some examples are given below. It also occurs fossilized in the word aalaboorinjoon ‘elders’ and in balgnarinjoon ‘take in marriage.’

(L103.047)

In some cases, the translations of the sufﬁxes imply that -injoon means ‘together’, and one retranslation of a word from the Laves collection, boonganinjoon ‘initiation.grade-INJOON’, as boonganinamilji ‘initiation.grade-TOGETHER’ would imply such a gloss (see (5.30)).83

‘They had three children, two of them were both boongana men, and

(L93.002)

However, other examples imply that the sufﬁx rather implies that the referent (or referents) is being chosen from a set; that is, that gooyarrinjoon would mean ‘two out of a potential pool of a number larger than two.’ It has not been possible to conﬁrm this with current speakers, however.
This sufﬁx in the Laves texts does not appear to cause vowel coalescence; for example, we have the form gooyarra-injoon in the Laves texts without deletion or glide insertion, and this pronunciation was conﬁrmed by current speakers. The alternative form gooyarrinjoon, with vowel deletion, occurs in (5.27) above. This is the only afﬁx which allows hiatus in this way.

1.8. Region terms: -ol ∼ -booloo
Another unproductive derivational sufﬁx appears on the compass points ardi ‘(North)-East’ and baarni ‘South-East’, on some island names, and in the word Iinalabooloo ‘islander’. It forms the name which refers to the people who come from a particular area, as well as the area itself. Thus Ardiyol refers to the people who live in the ardi direction, that is the northeastern end of the Dampier Peninsula. It also refers to the region itself; that is, Ardiyol is also the name of the area which is ardi ‘northeast’ in Bardi country. Baarniyol is the name of the region that encompasses the South-Eastern booroo, bordering Nyulnyul and Nimanburru country on the Eastern side of King Sound. Older speakers also used forms such as Jalan-ola ‘people from Jalan’ (Maggie Davey, 2003) and Nilagoonola ‘people from Nilagoon’. Others are attested in the Laves’ materials.
Bardi’s -ol is regularly from *a-booloo, and is cognate with -bulu in Nyikina and Yawuru. I assume that the region terms are formed not directly

Derivational morphology 185
from the compass points but from the longer stems ardiya and baarniya. Wardiyabulu ‘People from One Arm Point’ is a term that is wide-spread in the Western Kimberley; it is from Nyikina or Yawuru and shows the full form of the sufﬁx.
The form Iinalabooloo ‘islander’, which refers to someone who belongs to the islands around Jayirri, between the mainland and Sunday Island, also shows the full form of the sufﬁx. The word for ‘island’ is iinalang; presumably the word iinalabooloo comes from *iinalang-bulu with loss of the nasal.84

1.9. ‘Only, just’: -mil(j(i))

The sufﬁx meaning ‘only’ or ‘just’ is given in Metcalfe (1975b) and Metcalfe (1975a) as a ‘comparative’ and ‘semblative’ sufﬁx, of the form -mil. Aklif and I have both recorded the sufﬁx as -mil, -milj, or -milji. I treat -mil and -milj as equivalent since i have no reason to separate them; see below for discussion of interpretations of the extra syllable.
In current Bardi, the only time this form is used regularly is in expressions such as the following (5.31):

(5.31) Birriibo arinyjimil irrganbala.

Birrii-bo

arinyji-mil irr-ganbala.

mother-daughter one-MIL 3A.-appearance

‘Mother and daughter look the same.’

Further evidence for the sufﬁx comes from examples such as (5.32):

(5.32)

a. Ngaadamiljarr irr golinyarr. Ngaada-milj=arr irr goli-nyarr. short-JUST-AUG 3A FM-COM/DYAD

‘I threw my lines, I only got two ﬁsh.’

(Aklif 1999:-bidi-)

186 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

There are also some examples where the form -milji refers speciﬁcally to a pair of animals, and might be better glossed as ‘pair’:

(5.33) Nyina gooyarra ingarrinan joorroomilji naloorroo ngarri jirra biili.

‘Straightaway he threw his spear at the pair of tiger snakes and hit

both of them with the single spear.’

(L155.011)

Here the word inﬂected with mil(j) takes plural agreement (the oblique clitics =jirr(i)), and the context of the narrative indicates that it is a pair of snakes that are discussed. This sufﬁx also alternates with -injoon (see §5.1.7), as in the following:

(5.35) Arinyjon aamba ingorrorrgorrgorndin gooyarrinjoonanim joorroo.
Arinyj-on aamba i-ng-orr-orrgorrgorndi-n gooyarr-injoona-nim one-LOC man 3-PST-AUG-tie.up-PST two-INJOON-ERG jo˙ orroo. snake

‘The two snakes together tied up the one man.’

(L155.017)

This is the only sufﬁx that appears both with and without a ﬁnal -j. One option would be to treat the -j as a separate sufﬁx of unknown meaning; however, that solution is arbitrary. Another option would be to equate it with the simultaneous action marker -j (§11.2.7). However, that sufﬁx otherwise occurs only on verbs. There are a few preverbs which are recorded both with

Derivational morphology 187
and without a ﬁnal j, for example ‘ﬁll up’ is recorded both as wiiny and as wiinyj; see §13.6.7.3. Lastly, if the -j is morphological, it could be a reﬂex of the sufﬁx -ja identiﬁed by Metcalfe (1975a) but not found elsewhere in my data; see §5.1.11.3.

1.10. ‘-ward’: -ngarr(a) on compass points

Bardi has a marker -ngarr, which occurs only on compass points; alangarr means ‘southward’, for example (cf. alang ‘south’), and ardingarr ‘northwards’. This is not to be confused with the emphasis marker =angarr, which is an allomorph of =jangarr (cf. §10.5).

(5.36) Darr inarna marlarrjina innyana malarrnimarla gala garrgooy inargana nyalaboo jarrgany inamana ardingarra.

Darr i-n-ar-na

‘He came and caught his wife by the hand and married her (lit, ‘picked her up’), then they crossed over to the north.’ (L98.008 )

This sufﬁx is recognized but not preferred in usage these days. I have very few spontaneously produced examples. Instead, speakers tend to use the allative case marker -ngan (see §5.4.4) in this function.

1.11. Minor derivational morphemes
The older sources for Bardi, particularly Metcalfe (1975a) and Nekes and Worms (1953), list several morphemes that I have been unable to conﬁrm with current speakers. They do not appear in my corpus and were not recognized when discussed in elicitation sessions. I list them here with the examples known to me. In some cases there is indication that the afﬁxes were fossilized or barely known even in Metcalfe’s time. Some additional morphemes in Nekes and Worms (1953) were identiﬁed as Nyulnyul rather than Bardi; they are not discussed here.

188 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

1.11.1. ‘Emphatic’ markers: -arr, -orr, -goorr, -arranga

There are a few items in the Metcalfe corpus glossed as ‘emphatic’ which current speakers recognize but do not use themselves, and are hard-put to deﬁne. One of these is -arr, which is glossed as an ‘emphatic’ marker. It may be related to a cliticized or fast speech form of the interjection arra, which is an expression of surprise. There are two other examples of a sufﬁx -arra or -rra; one in the word baawarra ‘childhood’ (cf. baawa ‘child’) and the other in ginyinggarra ‘then’; I assume this is a frozen relic of the Nyulnyulan temporal sufﬁx *-karra, which is otherwise not found in Bardi (see Nekes and Worms 1953). Another example is found in (7.74).85
Metcalfe (1975a) also has an item -orr which occurs on pronouns:

(5.37) joo-orr ‘only you’

There is one example of an intensiﬁer -jodorr:

(5.38) Gooyarra boordij-jodorr aarli.

two

big-JODORR ﬁsh

‘Two really large ﬁsh.’

(Metcalfe 1975a)

Metcalfe gives a sufﬁx -arranga and says it means ‘very’, but there are no examples. I suspect that this might be an error for =angarr, which could be glossed as ‘just’ or ‘very’ in phrases like moorroolangarr jawal ‘it’s just a story,’ or ‘it’s only a little story;’ see further §10.5. Finally, there is -goorr, also found only in Metcalfe (1975a) and given as a ‘specifying’ sufﬁx ‘that one’; the only word given as an example is joodagoorr ‘that’s the one’, and while this was recognized by speakers in 2008, it was said to be obsolete; people would say gardi ginyinggi ‘still 3MIN’ ‘just this one’ instead.

1.11.2. Meaning unknown: -inyan
This sufﬁx is found frozen on a number of forms. It is given only on the word marroolinyan ‘facing in the opposite direction’ in Aklif’s notes. Metcalfe (1975a) has a note that it is a fossilized sufﬁx which appears to occur on some nouns, with unknown meaning. Metcalfe also lists a sufﬁx -nyan ‘across’ but I have been unable to conﬁrm this. In my data, nyan is a deictic stem; see §7.8 and the word nyanbirronony ‘the other side’.

Derivational morphology 189

These are the nouns which end in -inyan in Aklif (1999) and Metcalfe (1975a):

(5.39)

birrinyan ‘queenﬁsh (Scomeroides tol, tala, commersonnianus, lysan’) Jinbiidinyan ‘place name (Brown’s camp)’ Jarrinyan One Arm Point Bardi name for Djarridjin community loorroonbiidinyan ‘ﬂying ﬁsh (Cypselurus sp.)’ Loorroordinan ‘place name’ mangalinyan ‘helper’ marrinyan ‘greedy person’ orronbidinyan ‘water insect’ marroolinyan ‘facing the other way’ Rarrmalinyan ‘place name’ Rirrgalinyan ‘place name (cf. rirrga ‘hot coals’)’ walwaldinyan ‘sea snake species (probably Astrotia stokesii)’

Evidence for a frozen sufﬁx in these words comes from stress patterns; words such as marroolinyan have a secondary stress on their penultimate syllable (IPA /"maru­liñan/), which is irregular. Words of this shape normally have a secondary stress on the ﬁnal syllable of the word, as discussed in §3.5.2.

1.11.3. ‘Specifying’: -ja

Metcalfe (1975a) gives a sufﬁx -ja, in the following example:

(5.40) midijinnganja
midijin-ngan-ja medicin-ALL-JA

‘This is the medicine I asked for.’

(Metcalfe 1975a)

Nothing further is known about this sufﬁx. There are a few items which appear with or without a ﬁnal -j (or occasionally -ji in the Laves materials) but they do not appear to have a ‘speciﬁc’ meaning. Current speakers did not recognize it. It may be related to the sufﬁx -jV discussed in §6.3.2.

190 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
1.11.4. ‘Product’: -dany
The sufﬁx -dany is found on the word aalgadany ‘in the sunshine’ (cf. aalga ‘sun’), goowidany ‘in moonlight’ (cf. goowidi ‘moon’) and the deictic jiibadany ∼ jiibordany ‘this way’ (cf. jiiba ‘this’). While the relationship between the derived words and their roots is fairly clear in these individual cases, the sufﬁx is not productive and is not found elsewhere in the corpus.

1.11.5. ‘Group’: -wadin
This sufﬁx is found in a few names, such as Injawadin (also recorded as Injawardin), a name for the Sunday Island dialect of Bardi, or Mayoowadin, the word for ‘mainlanders’ or ‘mainland Bardi’ people. It is only recorded in Laves and Metcalfe and there is no etymology for the stems to which it attaches. The presence of a w in the sufﬁx strongly implies that it is a loan, since both b and w lenite to zero in this position historically in Bardi.

1.11.6. Frozen case marking

There are occasional items which have a case marker absorbed into the stem. They function as nouns or adverbs.

(5.41)

a. oonkoolgo ‘clouds which come from the north-west’ (noun), from oonkool ‘open ocean’ + ABLATIVE
b. joodinygo ‘forever’ (adverb), cf. joodiny, which has the same meaning

(5.41b) shows a doublet both with and without a case marker; both mean ‘forever’ or ‘always’ and appear to be exchangable.
The adverb bornko ‘around’ seems to be no longer felt to be the ablative of baarnka ‘outside’, even though that’s what it must be etymologically. There is also a lative-marked form bornkony with the same meaning as bornko.
In some cases, there are doublets of derived and underived modiﬁers.

(5.42) (5.43)

a. loomi baawa ‘an orphaned child’ b. loomiyoon baawa ‘a neglected child’ a. garnk(a) aarli ‘raw ﬁsh’

Case morphology: Preliminaries 191 b. garnkagij aarli ‘ﬁsh that hasn’t been cooked properly’

1.12. Remnant preﬁxal marking

While the only productive nominal preﬁxing in Bardi is found in the realm of possessive marking (§7.5), there are a few words which appear to be related but which have slightly different ﬁrst syllables. The pair alboorr ‘plenty’ and jalboorr ‘few’ is probably coincidental, since there is no systematic relationship between words with j- and those without.
A second set of preﬁxal terms, however, do appear to show a frozen preﬁx. These are collective kinship terms which appear with and without an initial oo-. Forms are given in Table 5.3. Some of these terms are associated with particular dialects; for example, oomalarr is said to be particularly associated with Jawi, and the regular Bardi word is yagoo (which is a loan from a PamaNyungan language).

This marking is not found to my knowledge in other Nyulnyulan language and I can ﬁnd no etymological source of the preﬁx.

2. Case morphology: Preliminaries
In the following sections I give the forms (and allomorphs) and usage illustrations of the cases recorded in Bardi. McGregor (1990) and McGregor and Stokes (2004) argue that the languages of the Kimberley region do not have case inﬂection; they call these markers ‘postpositions.’ Dryer (2011) classiﬁes the Bardi type of inﬂection as cliticization. However, there are differences between the languages and as I show here, what we have in Bardi is clearly

192 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

case inﬂection. Syntactic arguments are presented in §8.5.1 and §5.2.2 below. Table 5.4 gives the a summary of Bardi case forms and references to where they are discussed in this chapter.

2.1. Position of case marking
Case marking is phrasal; the case marker appears after the ﬁrst element of the phrase. See, for example, the sentences in (5.44) below, where successive more complex ergative-marked noun phrases all have the ergative case marker -nim on their ﬁrst constituent. This is an unusual pattern; it is a type

Case morphology: Preliminaries 193

of second position group inﬂection. It is consistent with other second position phenomena in the language (such as the placement of sentential clitics).

We might therefore consider case morphology to be another instance of a second position phenomenon in Bardi. Second position clitics pervade the clausal syntax and are important in other types of phrasal marking as well. Further discussion of the syntax of case marking is provided in §8.5.2.

194 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
2.2. Case as a theoretical term
There is considerable variation among Australianists as to what is considered a ‘case marker’ and what counts as ‘derivation.’ The adnominal cases in particular are subject to this variation. The problem is compounded in Nyulnyulan languages by the distribution of case markers, which has led McGregor (1990) to treat them as postpositions. However, such an analysis then requires derivational uses of case marking to be analyzed as phrasal or compounded.
Many Australianists do not use the label ‘case’ simply for marking the dependents of verbs in a clause; rather, they extend it to certain types of adnominal and derivational relations as well, such as the comitative and privative (see Blake (1993), Dench and Evans (1988), Evans (2003c), Round (2009) and others for discussion). This is a plausible analysis for languages which otherwise have little derivational morphology.
As described earlier, Bardi has extensive derivational morphology in comparison to many other Australian languages, although most of it is not productive. The adnominal cases do not have the same distribution as the cases which mark grammatical relations, but they do not exhibit the behavior of the other derivational morphology either. There are items which are both caselike, in that they have relational functions to other nouns (and signal argument status in the clause) but also have derivational qualities. Examples in Bardi include the ‘source’ case -joon, which marks denizens, sources of materials, amongst other functions, but it also has a limited role in deriving nouns (e.g. daamanjoon ‘murderer’ from daaman ‘raiding party’, or gaariyoon ‘drunk’ from gaari ‘alcohol, grog’). The comitative case -nyarr has a similar dual role in phrasal or adnominal marking on the one hand, and in kinship dyad derivation on the other. Bardi is thus an interesting instance of a language which shows not only derivational afﬁxation but also derivational uses of case.86
McGregor (1990) and McGregor and Stokes (2004) treat Nyulnyulan case markers as postpositions rather than afﬁxes. Evidence comes primarily from their unusual distribution as second position clitics; McGregor (in press:§2.1) also argues that ‘although these are bound morphemes, they enter into syntagmatic relations with phrases or clauses rather than words, and mark the grammatical relations of these units to other units.’
That analysis is not correct for Bardi. There are several reasons why an inﬂectional case analysis is a preferable approach to the Bardi data. First is the morphophonological processes which the markers undergo. The locative

Core cases 195
and ablative cases condition vowel harmony (see §5.4.2 and §5.4.5) and undergo lenition processes, just as derivational afﬁxes do (see §3.6.2). Clitics do not show this behavior. The recent past tense sufﬁx -gal, for example, never lenites, and some other clitics show different lenition patterns from those of afﬁxes.
The second piece of evidence comes from lexically conditioned exceptions to allomorphy; for example, some words fail to trigger lenition. The locative of gaarra ‘sea’ is always gaarra-goon, without lenition of the sufﬁx. We would normally expect the form of this word to be gaarron or gorron (cf. goron ‘in the sand’). This is behavior which is consistent with an analysis of the items as afﬁxes which interact with their lexical stems, but not as clitics or independent words.
Finally, Bardi has an additional set of nascent adpositions; see §8.5.1.7 for more details. That is, there are adverbial markers which are in the process of grammaticalizing into adpositions. Therefore while the adposition analysis may apply to other Nyulnyulan languages, it clearly does not apply to Bardi on morphological grounds.
McGregor’s other argument against a case analysis—that is, that the inﬂected words enter into syntagmatic relations with phrases or clauses rather than words—is also problematic for Bardi. First, not all cases satisfy McGregor’s deﬁnition. As mentioned above, several cases have minor roles in derivation; this applies at the word level. Secondly, there is no general prohibition on afﬁxation marking clausal or phrasal relations. Much verbal inﬂection fulﬁlls this role, for example.
3. Core cases
Following Andrews (2007) and others I split Bardi cases into core and noncore. Core cases mark argument relations in the clause (all core arguments can be cross-referenced in the verb). Bardi has extensive marking of spatial relations through case; these are described in §5.4. Other oblique cases are given in §5.5.
3.1. Ergative: -nim
The ergative case is a relational afﬁx which marks the subject of a transitive verb. Bardi case morphology is purely ergative without split. Nouns, pronouns and demonstratives all take ergative case marking when they appear as

196 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
the subject of a transitive verb. There is no tense or aspect split either. There are, however, additional functions of the ergative case which are described in §5.3.1.2.

3.1.1. Form
The ergative case is -nim. It is invariant in Modern Bardi, although it causes a stem-ﬁnal rr to be realized as a stop d or as a tap, for example in the third person augment pronoun irr ‘they’, which has an ergative /idnim/ .87 Bardi is morphologically ergative but not syntactically so. It is not split-ergative; all types of nouns and pronouns receive ergative case if they are the subject of a transitive verb.
Laves occasionally records the ergative as -nim3. It is not clear if this represents an archaism (since the Proto-Nyulnyulan ergative was probably *-nima), metrical ﬁnal vowel alternation, or simply careful ﬁnal consonant articulation.

3.1.2. Usage

3.1.2.1. Subjects of verbs

In its most typical use, the ergative marks the subject of a transitive clause. (5.45) provides an example. Note that word order is extremely ﬂexible in Bardi and the relative ordering of constituents provides no information on grammatical function (see §15.1 for more details).

(5.45) Aambanim aarli inamboona. Aamba-nim aarli i-na-m-boo-na. man-ERG ﬁsh-ABS 3-TR-PST-spear-REM.PST

‘The man speared the ﬁsh.’

Ergative subjects are not required to be either animate or personal; there are also a considerable number of examples of inanimate subjects, such as gaarra ‘the sea’ in (5.46), which take ergative marking:

(5.46) Ngarri boolji gaarranim innyana niyarda.

Ngarri boolji gaarra-nim i-n-nya-na

‘He went to the sea for ﬁsh; he put his hand in a hole in the reef and

a ﬁsh barb poked him.’

(L77.001)

While the most common case pattern for transitive clauses has the subject in the ergative and object in the absolutive, there is also a limited set of verbs where the subject is ergative and the other argument is cross-referenced on the verb with oblique marking. Verbs such as -lirrmi- ‘call out to’ and -jargi- ‘fear’ are formally intransitive (that is, they take the intransitive set of preﬁxes; see §12.2.1.2) but nonetheless have an ergative-marked subject.

‘The curlew called out to us.’88

(Aklif 1994d:3)

3.1.2.2. ‘Unexpected’ subjects

The ergative is occasionally used on intransitive subjects with monovalent verbs, where the agent is either unexpected or highly involved. The canonical subject marking of daag -joo- ‘sleep’ is absolutive, as seen in (5.49b). In (5.49a), however, the subject go˙owa ‘mermaid’ is marked by the ergative. (5.50) is another example of an intransitive verb (-jimbi- ‘die’) where the subject appears with the ergative case.

‘Listen everyone. You know that Jesus died for us.’ (BE: CB52.1)

This type of ergative marking is very rare in Bardi, and further examples have proven impossible to elicit, though examples are occasionally found in spontaneous speech, such as (5.49a) and (5.50) above. It is more common in the other Nyulnyulan languages to the South, especially the Eastern languages Yawuru and Nyikina. In Nyikina, the case cognate with Bardi’s -nim is described by Stokes (1982a:128–131) as an ‘active’ marker; it is optional with canonical ‘subjects’ and can be used with intransitive verbs. Its use is closely tied to the degree of ‘agency’ the subject can control, and the amount of volitionality. McGregor (2006a) provides further information.

3.1.2.3. Low-animacy causers
The other major use of the ergative is to mark low-animacy causers. In this case the subject is the high-animacy patient and it takes the subject agreement marker on the verb. In (5.51), for example, ‘cold’ is third person, but the agreement marking for subject on the verb is ﬁrst person. This construction

Core cases 199

is used for cases where there is a mismatch between agenthood and animacy. That is, it is particularly common when low-animacy causers act on highanimacy patients.

(CB53.2)

Bardi also has an instrumental case, which can be used in some circumstances which overlap with the causal ergative use. Some examples are given in §5.3.4. Speakers differ as to how widely this construction can be used. Some speakers allow constructions such as that illustrated in (5.54a), where the subject is gaara ‘ground’ and the causer, no˙orroo ‘ﬁre’ receives ergative case. Others prefer a different complex predicate, with the light verb -ma‘put’, as illustrated in (5.54b), where there is no misalignment between subject marking and ergative case.

200 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

Bardi has a set of verbs which allow several argument frames; they are discussed in detail in §12.2.3. It is possible to use high animacy ergative causers with alternative preﬁxing verbs, but they never occur in texts. Elicited examples were judged grammatical, however. In (5.55a), for example, the verb is intransitive and shows third person minimal agreement, agreeing with joongoorr ‘woman’s ﬁshing spear’. Example (5.55b) provides a contrastive sentence, where the verb is transitive (as shown by the transitive preﬁx n-) and verb agreement is with the ergative-marked subject. (5.55a) is translated as passive to provide a contrast, but I make no claim that this construction is truly a passive.

‘I broke the joongoorr.’

3.1.2.4. With +moonggoon ‘knowledge’

Ergative marking is used in ‘knowing’ constructions with the inalienable noun +moonggoon ‘knowledge’. The word is a noun and takes the nominal agreement pattern for possessor, not the verbal one. The ‘knower’ takes ergative case, like possessors in examples such as (5.57) below.

(5.56) Ngayoonim ngamoonggoon milimilingan mawoon Barding ngaanka.

Ngayoo-nim nga-moonggoon milimili-ngan ma-woo-n Bardi-ng

1MIN-ERG 1-know

paper-ALL INF-poke Bardi-INS

ngaanka.

language

‘I know how to write in Bardi.’

We might be tempted to argue that sentences such as (5.56) show an elided verb which is triggering ergative case; the verb of possession -laba- ‘hold,

Core cases 201
possess’ takes an ergative subject, for example; however, there is no alternation in this phrase between examples with a full verb and those without. Another analysis would be to assume that ngamoonggoon is a preverb in a complex predicate construction (see Chapter 13). The construction that is used to translate the English verb ‘learn’ is +moonggoon -joo-, and could be translated literally as ‘come to know’ or ‘become knowledgeable’; however, light verbs in complex predicates are not normally omitted. Therefore it is probably preferably to treat this pattern as an example of a noun assigning case to a complement.

3.1.2.5. With possession

The ergative in Bardi is also used with possessors when the possessum is elided.

(5.57) Liinanimjin
Liina-nim=jin Lena-ERG-3M.POSS

‘It’s Lena’s.’ (5.58) Nganynginy jarri gaanyganim ambooriny jirra.

(overheard)

‘Nganynginy [turtle increase song] is mainland people’s.’ (BE:SNG1/6)

This is another instance of a construction where it might be appealing to argue for an elided verb. However, while such an analysis would explain the presence of case marking, it is unclear why we should posit the presence of an elided verb only in instances where the possessum is also elided.

3.1.3. Optionality in ergative marking
When a matrix clause object is coreferential with an embedded clause subject, no ergative marking appears:

202 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

(5.59) Nyalab ingalamankan iindoo ingilirrmana.
Nyalab i-nga-lamanka-n iindoo-ø here 3-PST-aug-hear-CONT curlew-ABS i-ngi-lirrma-na. 3-PST-call.out-REM.PST.

‘There they heard the curlew singing out.’

(Aklif 1994d:4)

It is not possible to show for certain which clause the argument iindoo ‘curlew’ is in; it could be either a null-marked ergative subject or an object (in which case we would not expect ergative marking, of course). Intonation does not help because these chained clauses tend to have a single ﬂat intonation contour; they resemble serial verb constructions in their intonation.
There are a few other places where ergative marking is optional in Bardi. When the actor is clear from context, for example, the ergative marker is occasionally omitted, especially if the NP is a complex one:

(5.60)

‘My child speared a turtle.’

(Aklif 1994a:E0/9)

Ergative marking is also regularly omitted when the ergative-marked argument is relativized; further examples can be found in §16.7. The third case where we might expect an ergative to appear is on the subjects of second person minimal imperatives. In those cases, the ergative is most frequently absent (though there are examples with the ergative present); these are given in (5.61).

Absolutive forms are also used for verbless sentences, except in the cases described elsewhere, for example with the noun +moonggoon ‘knowledge’ and possessors with an elided possessum.

3.3. Dative/Causal: -ji ∼ -i

Bardi has no distinct dative case, although it does have a reﬂex of the ProtoNyulnyulan dative case in ‘causal’ meaning. The causal has a very limited distribution and is used regularly only with the verb -monyji- ‘ﬁght one another’ (see (5.63)).

Core cases 205

Dative arguments (that is, arguments that are marked with the dative case in other Nyulnyulan languages) are expressed with the absolutive in Bardi, with oblique cross-referencing on the verb. The oblique free pronoun is not used when there is IO marking on the verb, however. Free pronouns appear in the absolutive in this function too, even though they have a distinct oblique form. For an example see (5.65).

‘I went to Marbiddy (e.g. to see her).’

One further piece of evidence that the dative is no longer a case in Bardi is that the word anggi ‘what’ means both ‘what’ and ‘why.’ Nyulnyul uses angkij ‘what-DAT’—with dative marking—to mean ‘why,’ but Bardi uses the absolutive in both meanings.

3.4. Instrumental: -ng(a)
Bardi is a little unusual (although not alone; cf. Heath (1986:379) for Ngandi and Heath (1984) for Nunggubuyu) amongst Australian languages in having distinct ergative and instrumental cases.90 In most of the languages of the continent, particularly in Pama-Nyungan languages, they are homophonous. We saw in §5.3.1 above that there were some constructions where the ergative and instrumental could alternate; the contexts in which this is possible are quite restricted, however.
The instrumental is not a core case under most functional deﬁnitions of case. However, it is included here under the label ‘core’ because of my definition that core cases are those who arguments may receive cross-reference agreement marking on the verb. In applicative constructions, instrumentals

206 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
may be promoted to object and receive agreement on the verb (see §12.4.2); in such contexts, however, the case marking may remain.

3.4.1. Form

Bardi’s instrumental case has two forms, -nga and -ng. The form with the
ﬁnal vowel is used when the stem ends in a consonant, while the form in -ng is used with vowel-ﬁnal stems.91 Some examples are given in (5.67)–(5.68).

(5.67) (5.68)

Vowel-ﬁnal stems: a. bardaga-ng ‘tree-INS’ b. irrolo-ng ‘spear-INS’ c. goolboo-ng ‘rock-INS’ Consonant-ﬁnal stems: a. nimal-nga ‘nose-INS’ b. nilamarr-nga ‘axe-INS’ c. langar-nga ‘bait-INS’

Final vowels which have been lost in citation forms surface when the instrumental is sufﬁxed to the noun. The word ilngam ‘ﬁsh poison’, for example, appears as ilngamoong in the instrumental, not *ilngamnga.

(5.69) Ilngamoong ingirrjimbij niimana aarli.

Ilngamoo-ng ingirrjimbij

niimana aarli.

ﬁsh.poison-INS 3-PST-AUG-die-MID.PFV many ﬁsh

‘Many ﬁsh died from ﬁsh poison.’

(Aklif 1994b:6)

In my 2008 and 2011 ﬁeld trips, speakers were producing some examples of the vowel-ﬁnal stem allomorphs with consonant-ﬁnal stems. This reanalysis of allomorphy resulted in consonant clusters in words such as nilirr-ng ‘lips-INS’. This would appear to be a change due to language death; such forms are never found in the materials before 2008.

3.4.2. Function The functions of the instrumental case are diverse.

Core cases 207

3.4.2.1. Means of carrying out an action

The instrumental encodes the instrument or means by which an action was carried out. The following examples are typical.92

(BMF.011)

Instruments are always inanimate. Animate ‘instruments’—that is, animate entities who carry out actions, with or without agency and volitionality— are either marked with the ergative (as agents or quasi-agents) or use the comitative.
The ‘instrumental’ can also be metaphorical (this example is from the Laves corpus and the lack of ﬁnal vowel loss is one piece of evidence that this is representative of an Island dialect).

(Aklif 1994b:6)

3.4.2.3. Material used in process

The instrumental may denote material used in a process, as in (5.76) below. Note that the material something is made out of is usually marked by the source case -joon (§5.5.2) rather than the instrumental.

3.4.2.4. Applicative marking

The instrumental is also used on the verb, in forming applicatives. In the canonical examples, the instrumental noun is promoted from adjunct to direct object and the verb takes a sufﬁx -ng, homophonous with the instrumental. Some verb pairs are formed in this way. The verb root -jiidi- ‘go’, for example, takes the applicative sufﬁx, and the resulting derived stem -jiidi-ngmeans ‘to touch’ or ‘to feel around for’. Note that -jiidi- is intransitive, whereas -jiidi-ng- takes not only an ergative subject (baawanim in (5.79) below) but also transitive preﬁxal morphology.

(Aklif 1999:-jiiding-)

The applicative argument can remain in the instrumental; that is, there is instrumental marking on the verb but also on the noun that is theoretically promoted. Applicatives are discussed in §12.4.

3.4.2.5. Body parts and instrumental marking

The instrumental can be used with body parts to denote means by which an action is achieved. In some Australian languages body-part instruments are unmarked, and quasi-incorporated (i.e. the equivalent of either ‘I handhit him’ or ‘I, my hand, hit him.’) In Bardi, however, they are not treated differently from other nouns, and receive regular instrumental marking, as in (5.80).

‘I hit him with my hand.’

There are a few examples in the Laves corpus where the location of hitting on a body is marked in the instrumental rather than (as would be expected) by the locative:

‘“Ask him if they hit him on the head with a long stick,” they

(L56.038)

It is unclear whether these are errors for locative marking (which would be expected from Modern Bardi), slips of the tongue, or a real phenomenon representing a change in the language between the older language and current speakers. The fact that there is more than one example suggests that it is not an error, but the construction was unknown to current speakers.

Local cases 211

3.4.2.6. Frozen instrumentals

There are a few other examples of forms which have frozen instrumental marking but which are opaque, or appear to be so, and are therefore probably not synchronically related to the case marking. The most common of these is arranga ‘without’, which is clearly etymologically the negator particle arra sufﬁxed with the instrumental case. §15.3.4 provides more discussion of this word and its syntax, which is that of an adverb.94

4. Local cases
Bardi has a set of cases which mark static location, motion, and direction (and sometimes more than one of these). They are discussed in this section.
4.1. Preliminaries
4.1.1. Differences in ‘goal’ marking
Three local cases—the allative (§5.4.4), the locative (§5.4.2), and the directional (§5.4.7)—can be used in different circumstances to translate the notion of motion towards a goal. There are, however, clear differences between the cases. They are summarized here; the relevant subsections provide more information. The allative -ngan is used to mark motion directly towards a goal; in many examples in the corpus, the goal is actually reached, though other examples indicate that this is not an entailment of the case marker. The locative case -goon, in contrast, is used to mark motion that not only approaches a goal, but reaches it and goes inside it (literally or metaphorically). The directional -madan is used for motion that approaches a goal, but which misses the target, either by passing to one side, or by stopping short. Finally, the local allative -goondarr marks motion which occurs inside the goal. Figure 5.1

212 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
gives a schematic representation of the differences between the types of goal marking. In each case, the circle represents the goal. There are other local cases which have some overlap in meaning (such as the perlative -jarra and lative -gonyi), but they are more straightforward.
Figure 5.1. Schematic representation of case use for marking goals of motion

4.1.2. Multiple case marking

Bardi has two compound cases: the local allative -goondarr and the form -ngandarr, though its wordhood status is unconﬁrmed. These cases appear to be built on the locative and allative respectively, but they also contain an extra element -darr. (There is a preverb darr which means ‘come’, but it cannot be synchronically related to the form which appears in these case markers.) Since -darr does not combine freely with other case markers and is not clearly etymologizable, I treat these two local cases synchronically as monomorphemic. One of the Jawi texts recorded in the Laves collection has a form with the allative and directional cases inﬂecting a single word; there is only a single example, however. The perlative -jarr is attested both alone and in combination with the allative -ngan. Finally, there are a few examples of ablative case markers which appear to be afﬁxed to a stem which has already been inﬂected with the locative, as in (5.83). All such examples come from the Laves texts apart from one from Nancy Isaac in 2001, though they were not judged ungrammatical by modern speakers.

(5.83) mor-on-ko far-LOC-ABL ‘from far away’

(L56.34)

Local cases 213

The rarity of examples makes it difﬁcult to come to any clear conclusions regarding the status of these forms. I see three possibilities; however I lack the necessary data to choose between them (and there is little likelihood that further data on this topic will become available). The ﬁrst option would be to treat these afﬁxes as compound cases. In some Karnic languages (Bowern 1998), local cases such as the ablative are afﬁxed not directly to the root, but to a stem inﬂected for the dative or locative case. It is difﬁcult to argue for such an analysis for Bardi, since the examples are so rare.
A second possibility is that the examples are real case doubling. Nordlinger (1997) discusses examples of multiple case marking in Australian languages and shows several syntactic contexts where doubling is possible. For example, Wangka-yutyuru allows both ablative and accusative case marking in examples such as (5.84) below.

(5.84) Wangka-yutyuru

PungkuwaRi-minya-nha kathi-nha kutu-Ru!

bag-ABL-ACC

meat-ACC pull-IMPER

‘Pull the meat out of the bag!’

(Blake and Breen 1971)

The Bardi examples do not ﬁt this pattern either, however. In (5.84), the ablative-marked phrase is also part of the direct object noun phrase, and thus receives accusative case marking in agreement with kathi-nha ‘meat-ACC’. The small number of Bardi examples clearly do not ﬁt this pattern, as (5.85) shows:

(5.85) Roowil ingirrinya nyalab booronko nyalab daabamb ingirrinyan Gaalgoondarr.

Roowil i-ng-irr-inya nyalab boor-on-ko nyalab

Gaalgoondarr.

climb=THEN 3-PST-AUG-catch-REM.PST G.

‘They were walking from his camp and they went up at Gaalgoon-

darr.’

(TRS.005)

The double-marked word booronko in (5.85) is not part of any other phrase; moreover, the types of cases which stack in Bardi are different from

214 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
the ones in Wangka-yutyuru, where core cases such as the accusative are doubled with local cases. This does not happen in Bardi, where the only possibilities for case combination involve locative followed by ablative or allative. If this is case stacking, it must have a different syntactic distribution from the types of stacking described by Nordlinger (1997).
An alternative analysis would be to treat -darr, -jarr and -madan as directional clitics, rather than case afﬁxes. There is little evidence against such a treatment, except for the fact that such clitics would be the only clitics in the language that required a host in a particular case form (and from a particular word class). In favor of such an analysis is the fact that -jarr apparently does not lenite on vowel-vowel stems. This makes it phonologically unlike other j- initial sufﬁxes. However, such a solution is unavailable for the locative + allative or locative + ablative marked words, as illustrated in (5.85).
I have not been able to establish for certain whether the double-marked forms in the texts alternate with the expected forms; there is one example of boor-on-ko ‘place-LOC-ABL’, and one example of booro ‘place-ABL’, but no other examples have been recorded. If the examples do not regularly alternate, one could perhaps treat the doubled sufﬁx as a lexically speciﬁed allomorph of the ablative -go. Otherwise, it would be best to tentatively conclude that Bardi may show case stacking in local cases. See further §8.5.3 for a further apparent case of local case stacking, involving possessive pronouns.
Local cases can be combined with phrasal locational adverbs such as boogoon ‘inside’ and jimbin ‘underneath’. Further discussion of the syntax of these items is given in §8.5.1.7.
4.2. Locative: -goon
The locative undergoes lenition and triggers vowel harmony. It therefore has several realizations.
4.2.1. Forms
Allomorphs of the locative case are given in Table 5.5. The basic pattern is that the consonant-initial allomorph is used when the stem ends in a consonant; the consonant deletes if the stem ends in a vowel. If the stem ends in oo, the form of the locative is -oon; otherwise, it is -on. The allomorphy of the

Local cases 215

locative is somewhat irregular, as the phonological pattern described in Table 5.5 is clouded by several classes of exceptions. There is also some speaker variation.

-on

bardogon ‘tree-LOC’ (bardaga)

o˙ olon

‘water-LOC’ (o˙ola)

The ﬁrst set of exceptions relates to the presence or absence of ﬁnal vowels in stems. Some words can take either the vowel-ﬁnal or consonant-ﬁnal allomorphs. While we saw in §3.4.4 that prosodic and dialectal factors play an important role in whether a ﬁnal vowel is deleted or not, some of those same factors apply to the stem on which case is afﬁxed as well as to fully inﬂected words. That is, some speakers use vowel-ﬁnal stems, while others tend to use consonant-ﬁnal forms.95
Aklif (1999) gives the allomorphy condition of the locative with a slightly different rule. She says that the -oon allomorph of the sufﬁx occurs on high vowels. In my data, however, all examples of stems ending in -i take the allomorph of the locative in -on. Some examples are given in (5.86).

(5.86)

a. gardin ∼ gardini ‘cave’ > gardin-on ‘cave-LOC’ b. arinyji ∼ arinyj ‘one’ > arinyj-on ‘one-LOC’ c. ginyinggi ∼ ginyingg ‘3MIN’ > ginyingg-on ‘3-MIN-LOC’ d. goowil ‘baler shell (Melo amphora)’ > goowilon ‘baler shell-
LOC’

A few exceptions in the opposite direction also exist; that is, there are stems which end in non-high vowels but which have -oon as their locative form, rather than -on as expected from Table 5.5 above.96 Some vowel-ﬁnal words take -goon, rather than the expected -oon or -on. The same stems are

216 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

exceptional in the ablative as well, in taking -go rather than -o; see §5.4.5. The exceptions thus far discovered are given in Table 5.6. Some forms are attested only with exceptional ablatives, but they are listed here as well so as to give a more complete set of the forms which do not show the expected lenition patterns.

Table 5.6. Non-leniting locatives and ablatives

‘in the sea’ ‘in the ﬁre’ ‘headland’ (lit. ‘at the forehead’) ‘in a string bundle’ (cf. garrga) ‘in the cup’ (also gabgoon) ‘in the ground’ ‘in the dinghy’ (∼ dinggon ∼ dinggiyoon) ‘on Sunday Island’ ‘in [his] throat’ ‘in/on [his] stomach’ ‘from the law ground’ ‘where from’ ‘from Mayala’ ‘from the boat’ ‘from the small rock oyster’

These words must be listed as lexical exceptions; there is no pattern that can be discerned. Nor is there a historical reason for the exception. Some apparently exceptional non-leniting items are explicable etymologically. For example, the form Iinalabooloo ‘islanders’ (rather than expected *Iinolongolo, with lenition) is explicable if we take the base form to be iinalang-booloo. Here, the presence of the nasal blocks the stop from deletion, though the nasal itself is subsequently deleted. No such arguments are possible here for all forms; there is no historically recoverable consonant which would block lenition in the forms in Table 5.6. Some of these examples might be the result of epenthesis, but not all can be. A few might be loans, but loans can also take the regular alternating forms of the locative (e.g. the locative of bagidi ‘bucket’ is either bagidgoon or bagidon). Another exceptional loan in the list is gab ‘cup’, which has both regular gabgoon and irregular gabagoon as

Local cases 217
attested locatives. There is a possible morphological explanation for the lack of lenition in
some forms. If there is an additional morpheme of the form -ng in such words which appeared immediately before the locative marker, in many environments this sufﬁx would be lost; it would not appear in the surface form of the word, but it would protect the stop of the root from lenition. There are numerous examples of such morphemes in this grammar, as well as active alternations where a nasal-stop cluster alternates with a plain unlenited stop (cf. janabooroo ∼ janambooroo ‘where’). The trouble with proposing such a solution for the non-leniting locatives and ablatives in Table 5.6, however, is that there is no direct evidence for such an additional morpheme. Moreover, most words do not alternate; they receive either one allomorph of the locative or the other. This makes a morphological explanation unlikely.
A few nouns have augmented stems in the locative, where the locative is regularly added not to the root but to a lengthened form. The most common is the locative n-alma ‘3M-head’: nalmanon ∼ nalmonon. The lengthened stem is also found with the ablative case. It is tempting to relate the lengthened stem to the examples of case stacking described in §5.4.1.2 above. It is difﬁcult to argue that the lengthened stem is double-locative marking, however, as evidence from dialects without extensive vowel harmony suggests that the ‘extra’ stem formative is -an, which is not an allomorph of the locative case.

4.2.2. Functions of the locative

4.2.2.1. Location

The most common use of the locative case is to mark the static location of an item. The item can be ‘inside’ (as in (5.87)), at a location—as in (5.88)—or ‘on’ a place, as in (5.89).

The location of the item can be speciﬁc, as in the examples above, or it can be more vague. The locative is also used to express location in the general vicinity of an object:

The locative can be phrasal, as in the previous examples, and introduce an adjunct to the clause. There are also examples (although they are rarer) where the locative introduces a complement to a noun, and thus functions adnominally:

4.2.2.2. Motion

The locative is also used to denote movement towards a place. The allative case (see §5.4.4) is also used for motion towards a location, but the two cases contrast in meaning. The allative marks a goal of motion that is reached. The locative marks motion into or onto a well-deﬁned object, such as motion into a conﬁned space. Place names, for example, take the allative case rather than the locative, but bounded spaces such as ‘camps’ or ‘caves’ are marked with the locative.

In the Laves texts there are examples where the locative is used for generalized or serialized motion. In (5.98), for example, the protagonist of the story is going from island to island and camp to camp, talking to people as he goes.97 In this case, if the allative case had been used, it would mostly likely mean that the protagonist had gone to all the people as a single group.

The word mooyoon ‘in the morning’ also historically contains the locative case; most probably so does milon ‘a long time ago’.99 My corpus contains few productive uses of temporal locative marking. This is in part because time expressions are quite rare, apart from underived temporal adverbs. The only common example with a locative involves iidanngoorroon ‘at night’ (cf. iidanngoorroo ‘night’).

Some nouns do not take a locative sufﬁx when they are used in locative adjuncts. Instead, the bare noun appears. These were mentioned in Chapter 4. A list of the words which behave this way is given in (5.103), and some examples are given in (5.104). The word booroo is variable; it occurs both with and without the locative marker.

‘He (Mayala) stayed there alone, singing on the hill.’ (L152.004)

There is evidence that the null marking of location in these items is phrasal rather than morphological. When one of the words in (5.103) is modiﬁed, the modiﬁer is not marked for the locative either. If null marking were a purely lexical restriction on the surfacing of case on these particular nouns, we would expect locative marking on the word arinyji in examples such as (5.105).

Local cases 223

‘They always stayed in the one country.’

(L152.002)

The location case constraint applies only to the locative case; other local cases such as the ablative and allative are used with these nouns:

Goolboo garrin-ko ngay-nim nga-na-ngajingajimi-gal. rock hill-ABL 1-MIN-ERG 1-TR-REDUP-slug?-REC.PST

‘I threw a bunch of rocks from the hill.’

(GGG.019)

Another group of nouns which take null locative marking are place names which contain a historical locative. Place names which have been recorded with a null locative include Balalagoon, Ardinoogoon, Galinoogoon and Ngarrigoon.100

(5.107) Ginyinggon “gala arr ngandan barda,” ingarralalan Boolgoon nyoonoo Iwanyi garrin.

hill

‘Then “I’m going away,” [he said] and they saw him at Boolgoon,

there on the hill on Sunday Island.’

(GAL3.015)

Place names which do not contain historical locative afﬁxation tend to take locative marking; for example, Iwany(i) ‘Sunday Island’ is recorded in the locative Iwanyoon.

4.3. Local allative: -goondarr
The sufﬁx is apparently a compound of the locative case (§5.4.2) and an element -darr, as discussed above in §5.4.1.2. It shows the same allomorphy

224 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
conditions as the locative. It marks a type of distributed location. I have called this case a ‘local allative’ because it appears to be used in particular for motion paths which are restricted in some way. That is, it is used when the motion is in a well delimited space, such as a hole in a reef or a stand of mangroves. This interpretation certainly ﬁts examples such as (5.108) and (5.109). It is also used for multiple actors moving in restricted motion paths in a deﬁned area, such as a school of ﬁsh swimming around holes in a reef.

Nekes and Worms (1953:74) mention a sufﬁx -dar in Bardi and -dari in
Nyikina and Yawuru meaning ‘along’. Their example in Bardi is meridj-o. ndar ‘tight-rope-LOC-PER’ (mirrijondarr in the community orthography).

Local cases 225

4.4. Allative: -ngan

4.4.1. Form

The allative is -ngan. It is invariant in Modern Bardi, though in Jawi it undergoes lenition to -an when the stem ends in a vowel.101 (5.110) shows an
example of the Jawi form of the locative. In the Laves texts, the form is sometimes -Nan@, with an additional vowel, however none of the recordings from Metcalfe onward show anything other than -ngan.

drag 3-PST-AUG-carry-PST hill-ALL

‘He dragged it up high.’

(L57.002)

4.4.2. Usage

The allative primarily marks goals of different types; it can mark the goal of motion, or of an action; it thus also has the functions of a purposive case.
Allatives mark non-core arguments and are not cross-referenced on the verb. Note, for example, the alternation in marking in (5.111). In (5.111a), nyami ‘mother’s father’ is cross-referenced on the verb by the clitic =jin, while in (5.111b), there is no oblique agreement marking and the interpretation is that the food should be taken to grandfather’s house, rather than to grandfather himself.

226 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

4.4.2.1. Goal of motion

The allative can mark a goal of motion. The allative-marked phrase is usually a goal that is actually reached; movement of the ﬁgure alone is marked instead with the directional case, discussed below. In (5.112), for example, the allative-marked goals are actually reached.

(L100.002)

4.4.2.2. Upward motion

The allative is also used speciﬁcally for upward motion—that is, for climbing or traveling up something. In such cases, the locative is ungrammatical, as shown in (5.114).

(Aklif 1994b:8)

4.4.2.3. Purpose

The allative case is also used to mark the purpose or goal of an action. This purpose can be a noun phrase, such as an object one is aiming to get, or it can be a whole clause. (5.116) provides examples with noun phrases as purposes (for example, the purpose of a journey), while (5.117) shows a whole clause. (5.116b) shows an object of desire, which is also commonly expressed with the allative.

It is possible to have more than one allative-marked adjunct in a clause. For example, it is possible to use both a motion goal and another goal:

(5.118)

(L77.001)

4.4.2.4. Change of state
The allative is also used for the goal of change of state, for example with the verb -joo- ‘do/say’ to mark an object into which something changes.

4.4.2.5. Inﬁnitival complements

Embedded inﬁnitival complements are marked with the allative. Objects of wanting and knowing are marked with the allative; examples are given in (5.120). Verbs in these clauses are non-ﬁnite, with gerundial marking (see §11.3). Like all case markers, the allative appears on the ﬁrst word of the phrase. In bipartite (complex predicate) verb constructions, the preverb is the host for the case marker if the complex predicate is ﬁrst in the phrase; this is illustrated in (5.120b).

(NWY.004)

Further information on subordination and embedded clauses is given in §16.5. Embedded clauses can also be ﬁnite, in which case they can also be introduced by allative case marking. This is further discussed in the syntax of subordination.

4.4.2.6. Temporal uses
I have not found any temporal uses of the allative; examples where it might occur all use different strategies. For example, the way to say ‘for tomorrow’ or ‘for another day’ (e.g., ‘he put the food aside for another day’) is with ngoorrijarri, which is clearly related to ngoorrij ‘tomorrow’. Extent of time (e.g. ‘for two days’) phrases are marked without case; see §14.4.

4.4.2.7. Fossilized forms
The adverb ngoordingan ‘alone’ contains the allative case (cf. ngoordi ‘different’), but that is the only fossilized example of this case in the corpus, to my knowledge.

4.5. Ablative: -(g)o
4.5.1. Forms
Like the other g-initial case markers, the ablative has two allomorphs. The ablative is -go ∼ -o. Exceptions were noted under discussion of the locative

Local cases 231
and the same items which are exceptional for locative marking are also exceptional in the ablative (cf. §5.6). The ablative also conditions vowel harmony. Stems containing a harmonize to the o of the sufﬁx; this is, however, variable, not only in the words which undergo harmony but also in the number of vowels which harmonize for the words that do show the process. The word bardaga ‘tree, stick’, for example, has been recorded with ablative case forms of bardago, bardogo, and bordogo. There is more harmony in fast speech, and some speakers preferred forms with more harmony. This has not been standardized in transcriptions.

4.5.2. Usage

4.5.2.1. Location and point of origin

The ablative marks the origin point of motion. This point can be a location, such as a tree (in (5.122a)), a place name, as in (5.122c), or a ‘surface’, as in (5.122b). The ablative translates English ‘from’ and ‘out of’ in most cases.

4.5.2.2. Denizens
While most examples of phrases denoting where someone has come from are marked with the ‘source’ or denizen case -joon, there are a few examples where the ablative is used instead.
(5.123) Ngajana gandoorrman arinyjo booroo darr angarrarna. Ngajana gandoorrman arinyj-o booroo darr 1M.POSS countryman one-ABL place come a-ng-arr-ar-na. 1-PST-AUG-pierce-REM.PST
‘He is my countryman, we came from the same place.’
Examples are also found in the Laves materials, which makes it unlikely that the use of the ablative here is due to inﬂuence from English.

4.5.2.3. Extent of space
The ablative can be used in conjunction with an allative-marked phrase to indicate how much space something takes up:

Local cases 233
(5.124) Nilar miilygo niimidingan. Nilar miily-go niimidi-ngan. lower.leg ankle-ABL knee-ALL ‘The lower leg is from the ankle to the knee.’

4.5.2.4. Comparatives

The ablative is also found in comparative constructions. Examples are difﬁcult to elicit and they do not appear in spontaneous speech. A few good examples appear in Aklif’s materials.

(5.125) Jalnggoon boordijamba niwardago.

Jalnggoon boordij=amba niwarda-go.

J

‘Jalnggoon oysters are bigger than niwarda oysters.’ (Aklif 1994b:11)

The adverb ‘alone’, ngoordin, can receive ablative marking when it is used in constructions which denote that people are ‘different’ from one another. Examples are given in (5.126).

4.5.2.5. Construction material
A further rare use of the ablative is also found in marking the materials used in construction of an object. This is another meaning that is usually covered

234 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

by the ‘source’ case -joon. It is not known whether there is any difference in semantics between the ablative and the source case in such examples.

3-TR-make-REM.PST=THEN woman clay-ABL

‘Then he made a woman from clay.’

(MIL2.001)

4.5.2.6. Temporal uses

Unlike the other locational cases discussed so far in §5.4, the ablative is quite well attested in examples which have a temporal reference rather than a locational one. Like the locative, the ablative can be used with the third person minimal pronoun ginyinggi to connect clauses; the form is ginyinggo ‘then, from that time’. There are other examples of ablative marking of time, however; some examples are given in (5.128).

(5.128)

‘From olden times they have been using this road.’

As can be seen from these examples, many of the temporal uses of the ablative case appear in conjunction with the temporal adverb ngoonjoon ‘since’.

Local cases 235

4.5.2.7. Fossilized uses

Just as the other local cases showed some examples of fossilized uses in adverbs, so too does the ablative. It is found in the formation of the adverb malyginko ‘secretly’, for example, from the adjective malygin ‘secret’.

(5.129) Layoordoonimgid injalalanan malyginko nyalab, aarlimarr injoolanganan.

(WIR.004)

4.6. Lative: -gony(i)

The lative case means ‘to or at the side of.’ It has two forms: -gony ∼ -ony; it thus varies like the ablative case. Moreover, like the ablative, it conditions vowel harmony. This can be seen in (5.130). In addition (and unlike the ablative), it shows variation in the presence or absence of the ﬁnal vowel.

(Aklif 1993b)

Example (5.132) shows that the lative is a case, rather than a directional clitic. If it had been a clitic, the sentential clitic =gid ‘then’ would have been placed before -gony.
The lative case marker can be used metaphorically. The ‘bad side’ described by DW in (5.133), for example, refers to the current time, in contrast to earlier times before the use of alcohol at One Arm Point became more widespread.

(LSI1.019)

The adverb bornkony ‘on the side, on the other side’ has the lative case fossilized; I assume that it is fossilized here since baarnka on its own means ‘outside’, but bornkony can be used for items where ‘outside’ or ‘inside’ is not relevant.

4.7. Directional: -madan ∼ -mardan(y)

The sufﬁx -madan appears in Bardi sources in a considerable array of spellings. My own notes vary in retroﬂection (-madan ∼ -mardan); Aklif’s and my notes also have a spelling -mardany in several places. This is the only sufﬁx which shows apparent variation between n and ny. The variation in the recording of retroﬂection is unsurprising since it is quite difﬁcult to hear Bardi retroﬂection, especially away from stressed positions in the word. There is an unproductive derivational morpheme -dany (e.g. aalgadany ‘in the sunlight’; cf. aalga ‘sun’) and so it may have been that there was some confusion on previous researchers’ part between that and the directional marker described here.
The directional contrasts with the lative -gony in that the lative means ‘past’ or ‘to the side of’ something, while -madan is described as ‘straight there’ to ‘towards’ an object. Jessie Sampi gave the minimal pair in (5.135), where (5.135a) is used if the person throwing the ball is not trying to hit the target, but is trying to throw it sideways, past the person. The sentence in (5.135b) would be used if the person is trying to throw the ball directly at the person.

‘Throw the ball at me!’ b. Ngaymadan anangoola bal!
Ngay-madan a-na-ngool-a bal! 1M-DIR 2-TR-throw-FUT ball
‘Throw the ball at me!’

The directional sufﬁx can be used to delimit an extent; in (5.136), for example, the speaker is describing pains in her arm.

The sufﬁx seems to be more productive in the Laves texts, where there are forms such as aramardan:

(5.138) Biili joornk innyana aramardan.

Biili joornk i-n-nya-na

ara-mardan.

again run 3-TR-catch-REM.PST another-LAT

‘Next he tried to run in another direction.’

(L159.040)

In the Jawi materials recorded by Laves, there is an example of -mardan being afﬁxed to an item which already has case marking. The sentence is given in (5.139), where Mayalan is the Jawi form of the allative-marked place name Mayala (this would be Mayala-ngan in Bardi). This is the only example of multiple marking of this type, however.

(5.139) Ginyinggarra nyarralnana booroogoon jina goona Mayalan-mardan.

goona Mayala-n-mardan.

back M.-ALL-DIR

‘Then they went to their camps in Mayala.’

(L130.013)

The form mardan appears occasionally as a separate word in the texts recorded from DW by Gedda Aklif; this implies that the form might have recently grammaticalized.

(5.140) Goorr ginyingg mardan joogarra.
Goorr ginyingg mardan=joogarra. 2AUG 3MIN DIR=2A.IO

‘You go that way!’

(NAF.029)

Local cases 239

Although written as a separate word, mardan here is behaving as though it is attached to ginyinggi, since the two are forming a single constituent for the purposes of the placement of the oblique pronoun joogarra. If mardan was a fully independent word here, we would expect the order ginyingg=joogarra mardan.
The Nyulnyul cognate is -mardikan (McGregor in press:§5.11) and McGregor describes it as a type of allative. McGregor describes the meaning of the sufﬁx in terms of ‘a place towards which motion is oriented; there is no implication that this point is a target to be reached.’ This description also ﬁts the Bardi sufﬁx, since the Bardi forms can also imply that the person went past the target, or otherwise fails to reach it.
McGregor says that for Nyulnyul this item can only have a spatial meaning, and is only attested on spatial adverbs. It is certainly most common in Bardi on forms such as aanyjoomadan ‘back’, balamadan ‘in this direction’, and goonamadan ‘backwards.’ In Bardi, however, there are also examples where the sufﬁx appears on nouns:

(5.141) Anjoogoola boolngoorroo, niyalamardan joo jiya aarli, nalmamardan ngayoo jana aarli!

‘Break it in the middle: the bit towards the tail is yours, and the

(Dictionary)

Also unlike Nyulnyul, the Bardi directional sufﬁx can be used with time words in temporal meanings. This is illustrated in (5.142) below.

‘Then ran until very late in the afternoon.’

(BMF.006)

4.8. Perlative: -jarr(a)

The perlative is a rare form, and I am not certain that it should be analyzed as a case marker. It occurs in examples such as the following:

(5.143) Warrga injoon morrjarr.

Warrga i-n-joo-n

morr-jarr.

walk 3-TR-do/say-CONT path-PERL

‘He went along his path.’

(L72.019)

It is tempting to analyze such examples as instances of a cliticized demonstrative jarr(i) ‘this’, however, speakers say that this is not correct. Examples such as (5.144) also argue against it, since the demonstrative ‘this’ would make little sense in this example, in the presence of the locative adverb goona ‘back’.

(5.144) Goonajarr lool ingarrgardini, gaara gala ngoorb injoona.

Goona-jarr lool i-ng-arr-gardi-ni,

gaara gala ngoorb

back-PERL enter 3-PST-AUG-enter-REM.PST sand well soft

i-n-joo-na.

3-TR-do/say-REM.PST

‘They went in even more, since the sand was really soft.’ (LIZ2.010)

In the absence of further examples, there is little more that can be said about this case.

4.9. Toponym locative: -i
In Bardi place names have some peculiar properties which other nouns do not share. They take null locative marking, as described above. They also take a

Local cases 241

locational case which is only found on place names. The morpheme -i seems to be used to indicate action at a particular location.

3-PST-AUG-do/say-CONT.

‘They made their camp at Lalam.’

(DNG.002)

It is sporadically but solidly attested in both texts and elicited examples. It is also found in the Laves texts, though its identiﬁcation in that corpus is more difﬁcult, as Laves writes more ﬁnal vowels than other recorders of the language.

(5.146) Gala garrgooy inargana marlarrjini darr inarna booroogoon jini Boolnginyi.

3-TR-pierce-REM.PST place-LOC 3M.POSS B.-PLACE.LOC

‘So he married his wife and brought her to his country Boolnginy.’ (L98.009)

Some place names appear with the regular locative case -goon, while others appear only with the toponym locative -i. A third set of place names take null inﬂection, as in (5.147a). The name Iwany can also take the toponym locative, as in (5.147b).

It is not known what difference in meaning (if any) exists between the toponym locative and the regular locative in such forms.

5. Other cases
In this section I include the remaining Bardi cases. These include the comitative, source case, and the ‘reason’ marker -ganiny.

5.1. Comitative -nyarr
5.1.1. Form
The comitative case is -nyarr. It is invariant in the modern language, although Laves occasionally writes it with a ﬁnal schwa. From the Laves and Metcalfe sources the form might be better described as -inyarr, and that is etymologically correct. However, modern Bardi speakers use both -nyarr and -inyarr. Laves has forms such as jiiwa-nyarra (L110.007) ‘boomerang-COM’, where the case marker has a ﬁnal vowel. This allomorph is not recorded by other researchers, and appears alongside nyarr in Laves. It is quite possible that the ﬁnal vowel is simply epenthetic, an auditory effect resulting from a fully articulated trill.

5.1.2. Usage
The comitative has a broad array of uses, both phrasal and adnominal. The main function of this case is to mark accompaniment; however, there are also many other minor uses, including certain types of possession. This case is also used derivationally.

Other cases 243

5.1.2.1. Accompaniment

The most common marking of comitative case denotes accompaniment, where one participant does something along with another participant. This is illustrated below. There is no requirement that both participants be equal in animacy. This is a difference between Bardi and its close neighbor Nyulnyul, where the cognate morpheme -nyirr is only used when the item is at an equal or lower rank on the animacy hierarchy (McGregor in press:§5.4).102

‘He goes ﬁshing with his wife.’

(Aklif 1994b:7)

While (5.149) shows a typical example of an accompaniment phrase, where the verb takes singular agreement for the subject, some speakers also allow notional augmented agreement in similar phrases. Jessie Sampi gave the example in (5.150), for example, where even though the -nyarr-marked phrase is an adjunct.

3-PST-AUG-step.on-REC.PST snake

‘The pregnant woman and her husband stepped on a snake.’ (JS: 2011, p14)

244 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

5.1.2.2. Possession and attributes

The comitative is used in the formation of kinship dyads, as described in §2.6.2.3 above and §5.5.1.2.5 below. The dyad of goli ‘father’s mother’, for example, is goli-nyarr. It is also used to mark attributes of a head; this is an adnominal use. For example, the way to describe a married person is to use the comitative marker, as in (5.151):

(5.151) aambanyarr oorany
aamba-nyarr oorany man-COM woman

‘a married woman’

The attribute reading is clear in (5.152), where the attribute is ‘cheekiness’ or ‘anger’. In this way, the Bardi comitative resembles a proprietive case.

(5.152) “Aamba jiboordan biilinyarr,” injoonin.
“Aamba jiboordan biili-nyarr,” i-n-joo-n=in. man this.way cheeky-COM 3-TR-do/say-REM.PST=3M.IO

‘“There’s a man coming this way with a ﬁght,” he said.’ (L91.016)

Note that some languages contrast these two readings and use different cases. For example, in the Karnic language Arabana, the equivalent of (5.151) is translated with the proprietive, while the comitative is used strictly for accompaniment.

(5.153)

Arabana a. nhupa -mara
spouse -COM ‘accompanied by a spouse’ (i.e. husband and wife dyad) b. nhupa -purru spouse -PROP ‘having a spouse’ (i.e. a married person)
(Hercus 1994:93)

Such a distinction does not obtain in Bardi, where the proprietive -goordoo (see §5.1.6) is restricted in use. (5.154) provides another example of -nyarr signaling an attribute.

Other cases 245

(5.154) jiidinyarr aamba jiidi-nyarr aamba beard-COM man

‘a man who has a beard, a bearded man’

Attributes of this kind can only be temporary ones, however. Attributes which are state descriptions can be marked with the comitative; inalienable properties of items, however, are not compatible with the derivational use of this case, as shown in (5.155).

(5.155)

a. * goolboo-nyarr jaala rock-COM beach ‘a rocky beach’
cf. b. alboorroo goolboo nyoonoo jaala
alboorroo goolboo nyoonoo jaala many rock there beach
‘There are many rocks on the beach.’

(Aklif 1994a:L91/5)

Metcalfe has an example with ara ‘other’ where the comitative functions as a delimiter, and is glossed as ‘only one’.

(5.156) Arinyarr jinal ngannyagal. Ari-nyarr jinal nga-n-nya-gal. ‘only one’ spear 1-TR-catch/pick.up-REC.PST

‘I only picked up one spear.’

(Metcalfe 1975a:arinyarr)

I have no further examples of a similar type in the corpus, however. When the comitative is used derivationally, the inﬂected noun may also
receive phrasal case marking, as illustrated in (5.157). Such examples are all elicited, but they were independently judged grammatical.

(5.157)

(BOW-FN12/1)

5.1.2.3. Means of transport

Unlike in Nyulnyul (McGregor in press), where the comitative can mark instrumental functions, the comitative in Bardi is never used for instruments. The only situation in which the comitative marks anything resembling an ‘instrumental’ use is when discussing means of transportation, where both comitatives and instrumentals are possible options as case markers. This is illustrated in (5.159); (5.159a) shows the comitative example, which is the preferred case usage for means of transport. (5.159b) is also possible and means approximately the same thing. (5.159c) could also be used in this situation, but the meaning focuses on the location of the person. Speakers suggested that (5.159c) carries the implication that the person is still on the horse at the speech reference moment.

(5.158) Bard arr injoona barrawarnyarr Iwanyingan.

b. Yaawardang darr inarij. Yaawarda-ng darr i-n-ar-ij. horse-INS come 3-TR-spear-PFV ‘He came on a horse.’
c. Yaawordon darr inarij. Yaaword-on darr i-n-ar-ij. horse-LOC come 3-TR-spear-PFV ‘He came on a horse (and he’s still seated on it).’ (BOW-FN12)
In this case, the ‘means of transport’ reading seems to rule out a reading in (5.159a) where a man and horse arrive together.

5.1.2.4. Proximity, perlativity

Finally, the comitative can be used to indicate the proximity of two items or the direction of travel.

(5.160) Biinybanyarr arr injoonoo.
Biinyba-nyarr arr injoonoo. marsh-COM go 3-TR-[PST]-do/say-REM.PST

‘He went along the side of the marsh.’

(Aklif 1994b:7)

When older Bardi people are describing the routes they used to take to get from one place to another, they very frequently describe the route in terms of the path required to get form one place to another. (5.160) is an example of this. This sufﬁx appears to be somewhat similar in this reading to the perlative case marker -jarr, for which see §5.4.8.

5.1.2.5. Kinship dyads
The comitative case -nyarr derives some kinship dyadic pairs. Dyads are terms which refer to groups of people based on their relationship, such as ‘group of brothers’ or ‘grandmother and her grandchildren’ (see further Evans 2003b for detailed deﬁnitions). Bardi has several ways of forming such dyads,

248 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

including unanalyzable stems, the fossilized preﬁx oo-, and the comitative case. A full list of dyads is given in §2.6.2; the syntax of the comitative-based dyads is discussed here.
Comitative-based dyads include the following:

(5.161)

a. golinyarr ‘father’s mother and her grandchildren (that is, her son’s children)’
b. gamardanyarr ‘mother’s mother and her daughter’s children’ c. galoongoordoonyarr ‘father’s father and his son’s kids’ d. jamoonyarr ‘mother’s father and his daughter’s kids’

Agreement marking signals whether the meaning of the word is compositional (‘with X’) or dyadic (‘X-DYAD’); if singular, the meaning is compositional (as in (5.162a)); if plural, the meaning is dyadic, as in (5.161) above.

5.2. Source/denizen -joon
5.2.1. Forms
The sufﬁx -joon has two forms: it is -joon after consonants and -yoon after vowels.103 There are a few examples which imply that -joon has an origin with something that originally had a ﬁnal vowel. This allomorph is more common in Metcalfe but rare in the speech I recorded.

(5.165) Ngoorrmanjin banyjarryoon yaalngan arrinyan. Ngoorrmanjin banyjarr-yoon yaalngan arrinyan. mollusc.hinge/foot clamshell-SOURCE grease-PURP we.get
‘We get the hinge and foot part of clamshells for grease.’
There is some overlap with the ergative in marking of sources; however, the source case is always adnominal, whereas the ergative marking of sources is always phrasal. For example, in (5.164d), it is not possible to use the ergative; *joorroonim laanbirr is ungrammatical in this meaning.

5.2.2.2. Derivational uses

The source case can be used derivationally. It forms both nouns and adjectives.

(5.166)

a. gaari-yoon ‘drunkard’ (gaari ‘grog, alcohol-SOURCE’)

b. Mooyoonjoonoo ilma inamanajirri Goolyinimi.

250 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
c. miilayoon jarroonggoo miila-yoon jarroonggoo liar-SOURCE teeth ‘false teeth’

5.2.2.3. Result of process

The source case can be used to mark the result of a process. This usage is found in particular with gerunds.

(5.167) Monyjinjoon linygoorrnim inarligal aamba.

Monyjin-joon linygoorr-nim i-na-rli-gal

aamba.

speared-SOURCE crocodile-ERG 3-TR-eat-REC.PST man

‘The crocodile which had been speared ate the man.’ (CBFN)

Example (5.167) is interesting syntactically. The ergative case marker is on the head noun linygoorr rather than on monyjinjoon, which implies that the two words are not part of the same phrase. Case marking occurs regularly on the ﬁrst word of the phrase; since monyjin does not receive that marker, it cannot be part of the same phrase as linygoorrnim. The gerund is therefore unlikely to be a direct syntactic modiﬁer. However, an alternative phrasing of monyjinjoon-nim linygoorr is also possible, as is linygoorrnim monyjinjoon; all are said to mean a ‘speared crocodile’. It thus appears that the case-marked gerund can be both a direct modiﬁer of the noun and a secondary predicate within the clause.

5.2.2.4. Temporal uses
The source case is attested in temporal functions. (5.168) shows the source case in the sense of ‘month after month’ (or, more literally, ‘from moon and still from another moon’).
(5.168) Bawaninbawin ingirrinyanana ginyingg miinimbi gardi ara ariyoon goowidi agal ariyoon goowid garda.

(HHW.031)

‘These tracks here are from last night.’

(5.169) is a more typical example of a ‘source’ use, but where the source item is a temporal word.

5.3. Semblative: -marr

The form of the semblative ‘like’ case is an invariant sufﬁx -marr. It is not very common in my corpus as a simple case marker, although there are some examples on noun phrases. It occurs fairly frequently on temporal adverbs such as barnanggarr ‘now’, where barnanggarr-marr means ‘these days’, and is used in clause chaining.
As a phrasal marker, -marr is used to mark items which are similar to other items. In (5.170), for example, David Wiggan is comparing traditional ﬁshing techniques to those currently used by Bardi people. (5.171) is a further example.

‘They also ate oysters like Giido sooty oystercatchers (Haematopus fuliginosus).’

The semblative in Bardi has taken over many of the functions of the Nyulnyulan temporal case marker *-karra. That is, it is used to express the time at which something happened, as in (5.172).

(5.172) Ngay moorrooloomarrngay.

The temporal marking is also found clausally. In that case, the semblative is marked on the ﬁrst word of the clause.

5.4. Reason: -ganiny(a)

This case marker has not been recorded by Aklif and does not appear in Nicolas’ work or my ﬁeld notes before 2008, though I was able to get a few examples in 2008. I was unable to elicit examples such as this in 2003 and was always given ‘don’t do X, Y might happen’; that is, speakers rephrased the prompts to give biclausal answers. There are, however, several examples under -aniny or -ganiny of a ‘reason’ case in Metcalfe (1975a), and so it is discussed here. The sufﬁx has both vowel-ﬁnal and consonant-ﬁnal allomorphs.

‘Don’t let’s us two walk in that place because of the sharp reef.’ (Metcalfe 1975a:-ganiny)

Metcalfe (1975a) glosses the forms as ‘reason’ but it looks very much like the equivalent of forms which are glossed as ‘aversive’ in other Australian languages. Compare the following example from Walmajarri.

There is a possible cognate in Nyikina’s -gananya ‘including’ sufﬁx (Stokes 1982a:108-109). The sufﬁx in Nyikina is used on a less prominent or more peripheral participant.

6. Compounds
Bardi has compounding of several different types. Since most of these compounds involve nouns in some way, they are discussed in this section. Compounds are not particularly numerous in the corpus, and they appear to lack the productivity of compounding in some other languages (such as English).

Compounds 255

They also appear to have quite speciﬁc interpretations, which is also unlike languages such as English. Bowern and Borgwaldt (2008), for example, point out that a phrasal compound like English ‘banana bag’ can be interpreted with many different relations between the compounded items (a bag shaped or colored like a banana, a bag for carrying bananas (or that has had bananas in it), a type of nutritional supplement given in hospitals, and so on). Bardi compounds are not like that.
As is quite common in languages, it can be difﬁcult to tell apart true compounding from nominal juxtaposition. In Bardi there are two tests: juxtaposed items have two primary stresses, whereas compounds have a primary stress on the initial syllable of the word and a secondary stress on the initial syllable of the second compounded root.
Case marking is also indicative: if the items are juxtaposed, the case marker must appear on the initial element. In compounds, however, the marker appears on the end of the second item. In (5.181), for example, (5.181a) shows a phrase with the case marker on the end of the ﬁrst word, while (5.181b) shows case placement in a compound.

‘in Bardi’ b. jamoogamardanim
jamoo-gamarda-nim mother’s.father-mother’s.mother-ERG
‘grandparents’

Finally, there are phonological processes which apply across compound root boundaries but not between words in a phrase. In (5.182), for example, the fact that Laves writes malad-nimarla with a d rather than malarr nimarla (without the trill going to a d) shows that this is a single phonological word.

(5.182) Darr inarna marlarrjina innyana [maladnimarla] gala garrgooy inarganana nyalaboo jarrgany inamana ardingarra.

‘He came and caught his wife by the hand and married her (lit, ‘picked her up’), then they crossed over to the north.’ (L98.008)
I do not have any examples of recursive compounding in the data; the maximum number of items in a compound is two.105

6.1. Noun-Noun compounds
Only Noun + Noun compounds are at all productive. Verb stems may not be compounded, and neither can adjectives or preverbs. Neither can there be compounds of different word classes, it seems, unless some types of idiomatic complex predicates are treated as compounds.
There are several types of noun+noun compounds, including conjunctive (dvandva) compounds, descriptive (exocentric) compounds, and modiﬁcational compounds, which are endocentric and where the ﬁrst member of the compound modiﬁes the second member.

6.1.1. Conjunctive (dvandva) compounds

The most common type of compounds to appear in the corpus are conjunctive; that is, they are of the form AB and denote a group which comprises As and Bs. For example, goli-gamini means ‘grandmothers’, and is composed of the terms for father’s mother and mother’s mother respectively. Compounds of this type are also attested in the Laves corpus. Example (5.183) provides several instances.

(5.183) Jaalborlajinirr agal gaarragooloojinirr. Birriirrmooroojinirr.

Jaal-borla=jinirr

Compounds 257

258 Nouns and Nominal Morphology

This example is illustrative of a tendency in kinship compounds for the members of the compound to be either of the same gender or the same generation (or at least harmonic generations; see §2.6.2). The examples in the table also show that at least for some compounds, the items can occur in either order, and with both reference and address kinship terms. Many kinship terms form compounds like this; a non-exhaustive list is given in Table 5.7.
In the Laves texts we ﬁnd some examples of conjunctive phrases with the word agal ‘and’, for example gooloo agal birrii ‘father and mother’. Nancy Isaac reported that these phrases sounded rather unnatural to her, and the compound birrii-gooloo was a much more natural way of phrasing such sentences. The compound triggers plural rather than singular agreement, as shown in (5.184).

(5.184) Bardamb ingarranana aarlingan birriigooloonim jinirr.

‘His mother and father went off for ﬁsh.’

(BAL2.003)

There is one kinship compound which does not follow this pattern. Aalamalarr is a man’s son’s (or sons’) wives (aala ‘man’s child’, malarr ‘wife’). This compound is thus possessive rather than conjunctive. It is attested once, at L99.018.
Compounds of this type are found outside the realm of kinship too. One example is garndi-jimbin ‘above-below’, which means ‘the world’. These compounds are also found in the structure of generic ﬂora/fauna terms, such as aarlibarnangg ‘seafood’ (ﬁsh and shellﬁsh) and aarlimay ‘food’ (ﬁsh and plant food). These are collective compounds, in that their referent is the sum of each of the compound’s members.

(5.185) jiiw-irrola ‘boomerang-spear’ (i.e., ﬁghting equipment)

6.1.2. Descriptive (exocentric) compounds
Exocentric compounds such as jaala-niimarl ‘index ﬁnger’ (lit. ‘spear-ﬁnger’) are also found. These metaphoric compounds describe an item in terms of

Compounds 259

something else; in this case, the jaala-niimarl is the ﬁnger (especially the ﬁngertips, the part of the ﬁnger between the tip and the ﬁrst joint), metaphorically the ‘spear of the hand’ (the bit that juts out). Another example is goowidi-nalma ‘pith helmet’, which is a compound of ‘moon’ and ‘head’. These compounds are rarer. They are exocentrically headed, in that the meaning of the compound is not contained in a single element in the compound.

(5.186)

a. gola-gamarda ‘someone with a lot of grandkids’ (because they do the work of goli ‘father’s mother’ and gamarda ‘mother’s mother’ together)
b. maandi-niimi ‘eyebrow ridge’ (maandoo ‘brain’, niimi ‘eye’) c. noongoo-nimarla ‘palm’ (noongoo ‘stomach’, nimarl ‘hand’) d. nalma-noonggan ‘base of the skull’ (nalma ‘head’, noonggan
‘nape’)

Compounds of this type are quite common in some Australian languages; Simpson (2009:611), for example, lists a number for Warlpiri, particularly in the sphere of ﬂora and fauna (though she notes that Nash (1986:39) considers such compounds frozen). Bardi is noticeable in having very few plant and animal names of this type. There are imitative or onomatopoeic names, some loans, and many unanalyzable names, but very few compounds of this type. Like Warlpiri, they are also absent from toponyms.

6.1.3. Generic/modiﬁcational (endocentric) compounds

Part-whole compounding (or generic-speciﬁc) is the most common and productive; such compounding or pseudo-compounding is found across Australia (Wilkins 2000), although not universally. An example is mayala gooljoo ‘Mayala grass, spinifex’; a further possible example is jabiyang jo˙orroo ‘jabiyang sharks’. Case marking appears on the second word of the phrase, implying that the phrase is a compound:

(5.187)

Mayala gooljooyoon ingoorroomoogarnanarr ngirray milon.

[Mayala gooljoo-yoon] spinifex

i-ng-oorr-oo-moogar-na-na=rr

ngirray milon.

3-PST-AUG-TR-make-CONT-REM.PST=3A.DO huts long.ago

‘Long ago, they used to make huts from spinifex grass.’

260 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
Possibly also grouped with these compounds are forms such as ooranybaawa ‘girl’ (woman child) and miida-baawa ‘male, boy-child’. These compounds can all be paraphrased with ‘an X which is also a Y.’ Alternatively, they could be considered examples of modiﬁcational generic-speciﬁc compounds, with oorany and miida providing more information about the type of baawa referred to in the compound.
Further examples follow:
(5.188) a. baaliboor ‘camp’ (baali ‘boughshed’, boor ‘place’) b. aboogajaamba ‘mixed race person’ (aboogaj ‘half-caste’, aamba ‘man’)
There is a way of naming places which involves either phrases or modiﬁcational compounds. Several places in Bardi country have the same name; for example, there are several reefs with the name Mardaj. If further disambiguation is required, one can refer to Jayirri Mardaj.
6.1.4. Compounds with -booroo
The word booroo, which means ‘time, place, tide,’ or ‘camp,’106 also appears as an element to some personal names, such as Ngarrigoonbooroo. McGregor (in press) treats this as a compound, however I am not convinced that it ﬁts the pattern of other compounded elements in Bardi; rather, it appears closer to a sufﬁx, and is a type of denizen sufﬁx which appears on booroo names. See also §2.9.
6.2. Frozen compounds
6.2.1. Nominal compounds
Finally, there are a number of words which are transparently frozen compounds, but which do not participate in the productive (or other unproductive) compounding processes described above.
Some of these have unidentiﬁed components, such as marrgaliny ‘hammerhead shark’ (Sphyrnidae sp.), which gets its name because of a Dreamtime story where a shield (marrga) is embedded in his nose. The second component of the name (-liny) is unidentiﬁable. Some other ﬂora and fauna names also have this structure.

Compounds 261

6.2.2. Grammatical compounded words

There is some evidence for some grammatical words which are either historically compounds, or phrasal. These are given in (5.189).

(5.189)

a. ginyinggi ‘this’ < *kinya ‘3sg’ + *angki ‘what, something’ b. jana(m)booroo ‘where’ < *jana ‘where’ + *booroo ‘place’ c. barnanggarra ‘now, when’, < *ba(a)rni ‘now’ + *angki ‘what,
something’ + *-karra temporal case (see below)

The ﬁrst two items are clearly former compounds; *ginya is reconstructible as the third person minimal pronoun and other Nyulnyulan languages have equivalent forms.107 ‘Where’ is also straightforward. The third example, barnanggarra, is less certain; the ﬁrst element is clearly related to the reconstructible word for ‘now’, but it could be an inﬂected form with the temporal case marker (in that case, the nasal is unexplained). If such items are not compounds, they could be analyzed as synchronically univerbated but historically phrasal. There is some evidence for this process in recent years in Bardi. For example, the word for God is garndib inin, a phrase which is losing its second stress and becoming univerbated. It is analyzable as a relative clause.

(5.190) garndib inin garndi=b i-ni-n above=REL 3-sit-cont
Lit: ‘he who is above’

6.2.3. Noun–Verb compounds
There are two types of (non-productive) items in Bardi which might be described as noun + verb compounds. The ﬁrst is where the noun acts as a coverb in a complex predicate (see §4.4 and Chapter 13 for deﬁnitions and details). In such constructions, the noun in combination with the inﬂecting verb provides the predicational meaning of the clause. An example is given in (5.191).

262 Nouns and Nominal Morphology
(5.191) Boor inboo.
Boor i-n-boo. look.at 3-TR-hit
Other authors (e.g. Schultze-Berndt 2000, Simpson 2009) have treated such items as compounds, however here I do not treat them as such. Complex predicates have two primary stresses; one is on the coverb, the other on the ﬁrst syllable of the inﬂecting verb. (See §13.2 for examples where the coverb and inﬂecting verb coalesce.) Furthermore, noun + inﬂecting verb complex predicates do not deﬁne a speciﬁc type of complex predicate (though some other types of derivational coverbs do). Finally, complex predicates can act as a single phonological word with respect to clitic placement, but they do not have to. That is, a sentential clitic may appear either on the preverb or on the inﬂecting verb. Nominal compounds do not show this alternation. Thus for Bardi, we do not gain anything in the analysis by treating complex verb constructions as compounds.
The second type of potential N + V compound is fossilized and not identiﬁed as compounds with analyzable parts by speakers. This type comprises a noun compounded with a light verb; together this forms a complex inﬂecting verb root.
(5.192) a. -mirdi-bi- ‘run’ (knee-hit) b. -nganka-ma- ‘say goodbye’ (speech-put)

Chapter 6 Adjectives and Other Modiﬁers

As brieﬂy described in Chapter 4, noun heads can be modiﬁed by several different types of words. These are nouns, adjectives, other adjective-like modiﬁers such as numerals and quantiﬁers, and pronouns. Adjectives are a small part of the Bardi lexicon compared to nouns or preverbs; just under 5% of the Bardi dictionary headwords are adjectives, with just over 200 underived adjectives listed in the Bardi dictionary. Adjectives can also be derived through case and derivational morphology.
In this chapter I describe adjectives and other modiﬁers of nouns. I begin with an in-depth discussion of the criteria for distinguishing adjectives from nouns in §6.1.1 and composition of the adjective class (§6.1.2). In §6.2 I outline the quantiﬁer system and provide some discussion of the syntax of quantiﬁcation. §6.3 gives information about the morphology which is speciﬁc to modiﬁers. Finally, §6.4 discusses the numeral system, including cardinal and ordinal numbers, and morphology speciﬁc to numerals.

1. Adjectives

Bardi has adjectives which may occur in both attributive and predicative positions. There is often no difference in the shape of the adjective, though predicate adjectives may receive the marker -a (for which see further §6.3.3 and §8.3.3). (6.1) shows two adjectives in predicative positions.

(6.1) Langgoorr boordiji, ari moorrooloo.

L

big, A small

‘Langgoorr (Solanum cuninghamii) is big, ari (Solanum species, shrub-

like tree) is small.’

1.1. Identiﬁcation
There are several ways in which adjectives differ from nouns. First, while both nouns and adjectives may modify other nouns, only nouns can head phrases. That is, unlike in some languages, one cannot use an ‘adjective’

264 Adjectives and Other Modiﬁers
without a head out of context. One can omit the noun in context, but the context must be established. Thus (6.2b) is an acceptable paraphrase for (6.2a) in context, although (6.2b) is ungrammatical without a previously established referent of moorrooloo.
(6.2) a. moorrooloo baawa ‘little child’ b. moorrooloo ‘little <one>’
Another difference in the syntax of nouns and adjectives is also to be found in noun phrases. In a NP which contains an adjective, the nominal head can be elided and the modiﬁer used alone to refer to the whole phrase. This is only grammatical if the modiﬁer is an adjective. (6.3a) is the parallel of (4.6) above and shows the situation with the adjective. Moorrooloo ‘little’ may stand in context for moorrooloo baawa ‘little child’; the same is not true for (6.3b). In (6.3b) the modiﬁer of the noun baawa ‘child’ is aamba ‘man, male’. The phrase as a whole means ‘(the) male child’. Unlike in (6.3a), however, one cannot elide the head of the NP and use the modiﬁer alone without changing the meaning. Aamba on its own is a noun and means ‘man’, not ‘male something’.
(6.3) a. moorrooloo baawa ‘little child’ > moorrooloo ‘the little one’ b. aamba baawa ‘male child’ *> aamba (intended) ‘the male one’
The order of elements is usually modiﬁer + head, although the alternative order is found in texts when the modiﬁer is an adjective. When it is a noun, however, the order is ﬁxed.
Adjectives may combine with complex predicates to form inchoative, stative, and causative predicates. This is fully productive. Nouns cannot do this. In (6.4), the adjective boordiji ‘big’ is combining with the light verbs -ni- ‘sit’, -joo- ‘do/say’, and -ma- ‘make’. This set of complex predicate formation is possible with all items that are identiﬁable as adjectives. The combination of nouns with these light verbs in these constructions is ungrammatical.
(6.4) a. boordiji i-ni-n big 3-sit-CONT ‘It’s big.’
b. boordiji i-n-joo-n big 3-TR-do/say-CONT ‘It got big.’

c. boordiji i-n-ma-n big 3-TR-make-CONT ‘He/she/it made it big.’
a. *iila i-ni-n dog 3-sit-CONT
b. *iila i-n-joo-n dog 3-TR-do/say-CONT

The way to say that someone ‘becomes’ a noun is to use the allative case, as described in §5.4.4.
Another property that distinguishes adjectives from nouns is that adjectives, but not nouns, can be modiﬁed by giija ‘very’.

(6.6) a. boordiji giija big very ‘very big’
b. *iila giija dog very ‘very dog’

Finally, adjectives can be questioned with nyirra ‘how’ or jana ‘which’, whereas nouns are questioned with anggi ‘what’. In (6.7), for example, the question with anggi ‘what’ expects a noun as an answer, such as the type of ﬁsh caught (bluebone, trevally, etc). The question with jana (6.7b), however, asks for either a description of the ﬁsh (a ‘big’ one, etc) or identiﬁcation of the ﬁsh (e.g. ‘that one’).

(6.7) a. Anggi aarli minnyagal bardi?

266 Adjectives and Other Modiﬁers
1.2. Types of adjectives
Adjectives can be divided into several semantic classes, based on those in Dixon (1982). Examples are given in (6.8)–(6.14).
(6.8) Dimension adjectives: boordiji ‘big’, irrgadarr ‘big’, moorrooloo ‘small, narrow’, moonyooloo ‘small’, goolarr ‘small’, niiwandi ‘long’, ngaada ‘short’, ilil ‘wide’, jooloojooloo ‘narrow’, joondooloo ‘narrow’, joong-goorr ‘narrow’, gaanyji ‘thin’, joorroonggoo ‘straight’
There are several synonyms for some of the dimension adjectives. It is not known how they differ. Some have fallen out of use between items recorded in Metcalfe’s dictionary and my ﬁeldwork; goordoogoordoo ‘short’ is given in that work, but not recognized by current speakers, for example. All the examples of words for ‘narrow’, though collected independently, have the example of ‘narrow road’ as exemplar sentences, so it is not known how they might differ. The word goolarr ‘small’ occurs only with plural items. Laves noted it as a speciﬁcally Jawi word, but this has not been conﬁrmed. Likewise, it seems that irrgadarr ‘big’ is only attested with plural items.
(6.9) Age: gorna ‘new’, nyoongoorl ‘old (person)’, oowa ‘young’ as young of living thing
Coate gives the form baragarriyoonoo ‘new’ as a derived adjective in Jawi but it is not used by other speakers. Likewise, Metcalfe gives rijang ‘new’ but this was not recognized these days. The adjective moorrooloo ‘little’ can be used of something that is ‘young’; the word oowa is also used to denote the young of an animal. The word nyoongoorl ‘old’ is used only of people, not of things. To talk about the age of an object, loogal ‘bad, dried up’, is used, in which case the word also has a negative connotation.
(6.10) Value: gorna ‘good’, darrgal ‘true’, loogal ‘bad’, liinyja ‘sour, stinging, bad’, malygin ‘secret’, aab ‘exciting’
Both gorna ‘good’ and loogal ‘bad’ are quite broad adjectives and can be applied to many different items. Gorna, for example, is applied not only to items that are ‘good’ as a value judgment, but also to descriptions of music to mean ‘in tune’. The word aab ‘exciting’ is recorded in the older sources but cannot be used on its own in Modern Bardi as a regular adjective; instead, it is used only as a preverb in the complex predicate aab -joo- ‘be excited’.

Adjectives 267

(6.11)

Human propensity: ngoorimban ‘slack, lazy’, noonyji ‘alive’, biiwi ‘dead’, ongorr ‘cheerful’, olboor ‘upset, depressed, unsettled’, nyinyi ‘cunning, tricky’ (used when someone is trying to pull a trick on someone), laanybi ‘thieving’

Bardi has a number of emotion terms. Glosses should be considered approximate here; I do not have detailed information about the conditions under which these terms would be used, or the types of behavior which would be considered to be illustrative of these emotions.
Bardi has three basic color terms and a few terms which can also be used to refer to hue, though their primary meaning does not refer to color. The primary meaning of the word is given in parentheses. The word niinbal ‘appearance’ is used speciﬁcally to refer to color.

(6.12)

Color: a. Underived: maanka ‘black’, boolgar ‘white’, lamarr ‘brown-
yellow’; b. Derived: goororr ‘red (blood)’, jarriny ‘green (unripe)’, bilil
irrganbalamil ‘green (leaf-like)’

I do not have good data on the ranges and focal colors of each of these terms; I did some informal investigation of this using both objects in the natural environment, and sample cards showing different paint colors. Maanka is usually translated as ‘black’, but can also be used for colors which would be called shades of dark gray or dark blue in English. Lamarr covers the range of English brown and yellow. Shades called ‘light gray’ in English (such as items like the color of ash) are referred to as boolgar ‘white’. For items with colors in the range of English ‘blue’, such as the sea, such objects are generally not described in terms of hue. Instead, speakers make reference to the reﬂectiveness of the surface of the object.

(6.13) Physical properties: ngoorboo ‘soft’, raaga ‘loose’, wiinyma ‘wrinkled’, moola ‘hot, ripe, cooked’, inkoorr ‘cold’, ardid ‘crooked’, baybay ‘light’

Physical property adjectives are quite extensive in the language; the list given here is a small sample. Some adjectives are marked for aspectual qualities. For example, laalga ‘dry’ is only used for items which were once wet and have become dry, and binyja ‘cool’ is only for items which have cooled

268 Adjectives and Other Modiﬁers
down. That is, they are resultant states, not permanent characteristics. Another example is nooloon ‘bitten off’. Such forms are all underived.
(6.14) Speed: oombal ‘slow’, joornkoo ‘fast’
In contrast to the physical description adjectives, there are few adjectives referring to speed. In fact, it is doubtful whether joornkoo ‘fast’ is an adjective at all, since it can take nominal derivational morphology such as the ‘expert’ sufﬁx -iidi (a joornkiidi is a fast runner).
Finally, some adjectives are conﬁned to modiﬁcation of particular referents. A few examples speciﬁc to humans were noted above. Another is nilirr ‘strong’, which is used of tides to refer to the strength of a tidal current.

1.3. Argument-taking adjectives

Thus far there are no unambiguous examples of adjectives which take arguments. Adjectives which in English take complements are all members of other word classes in Bardi.
Words such as ‘hungry’ and ‘thirsty’ are primarily nouns in Bardi, not adjectives. To express that one is hungry or thirsty, a causal construction is used, with the noun in the ergative and the experiencer as the subject.

(6.15)

a. Anangay may! Manyjalnim alig nganjij.

A-n-a=ngay

may! Manyjal-nim alig

2(IMP)-TR-give=1M.DO food hunger-ERG feel.bad

ilogo manyarr-nim.

others well 3-PST-AUG-sit-REM.PST on.side thirst-ERG

‘Some lay down because of their thirst.’

(L103.025)

To say that one is hungry or thirsty for something, two clauses are used (that is, ‘I’m thirsty, I want water’, or ‘I’m hungry, give me something to eat’).
Other English adjectives, such as ‘ashamed’ and ‘frightened’, are complex predicates in Bardi. To say that one is ashamed of something, the phrase is

Adjectives 269
literally rarrjin -ma- =DO ‘X shames me,’ using a transitive complex predicate with the experiencer as a direct object (DO) and the cause of shame as the subject.
Spatial adjectives that take complements in English (e.g. ‘far from X, close to X’) are adverbial in Bardi. They are discussed in §14.2 below.

1.4. Adverbial modiﬁcation of adjectives

Adjectives can be modiﬁed by the word giija ‘very’ or its clitic counterpart =gij. There is also a quantiﬁer word ngarri which also can be translated as ‘very’ or ‘much’. The latter also has a somewhat negative connotation that something is too much of a quality (or done too much). It is also often used with nouns in the expression ngarri jina X ‘much is his/her X’, as in (6.17), in which case the ‘very much’ reading can be positive as well as negative.

(6.16) Ngarri boolji gaarranim innyana niyarda.

Ngarri boolji gaarranim i-n-nya-na

niyarda.

too.much exhausted sea.water-ERG 3-TR-catch-REM.PST 3-body

‘The sea had made his body worn out.’ (lit: ‘he was really tired, the

sea had picked up his body.’)

(L117.016)

(6.17) Balgarraniny gorna aarli, ngarri jirra laya agal ngarri jirra baangga.

ngarri jirra

baangga.

too.much 3AUG.POSS ﬂesh.

‘Small-toothed cod (Epinephelus microdon) is good to eat; it has lots of fat and ﬂesh.’

While ngarri always goes before the adjective, giija or =gij follows it. Furthermore, while ngarri is a general adverb which can both stand on its own in a predicate and modify verbs and adjectives, giija is attested only with adjectives. There is further discussion of ngarri in the following section, including the phrase ‘ngarri jina X,’ ‘there’s a lot of X’, which is only found with nouns.

2. Quantiﬁers

There are twelve quantiﬁers in Bardi. Arrajina is discussed in §15.3.4.1 below, and aankoo is listed here for completeness but is discussed in Chapter 14. The other items in Table 6.1 are discussed here with other modiﬁers because their distribution is very similar to adjectives. They can co-occur with pronominal modiﬁers, for example, like the adjectives discussed above.

(6.20) Ginyinggamba ginyinggi gaarranimbi inambarndining ginyingg boonyja booroo ginyingg gaarra.

Ginyinggamba ginyinggi gaarra-nim=bi

gaarra.

water

‘That’s where it was, this water, that covered the whole country.’ (FLD2.012)

It seems that quantiﬁers do not have much special syntax or any unique distributional restrictions in Bardi, at least on the basis of the information available at present.
Most of these quantiﬁers can be used either as attributive modiﬁers or as substantives, as shown in (6.21).

Note that in (6.22a), the object ‘stingray’ is marked twice as augmented; ﬁrst on the verb with direct object agreement marking, and secondly within the NP with the pronoun irr. This shows that number marking can co-occur with other quantiﬁcation
Boonyja can be modiﬁed with the clitic =jangarr, where it means ‘absolutely every(one)’:

b. boonyjamorrgoondarr ‘in every way’ c. boonyjabooroo ‘everywhere’ d. boonyambooriny ‘everyone’

Quantiﬁers 273

2.2. ‘Many, much, a lot’: niimana and ngarri

The meanings of niimana and ngarri are similar, though their syntax is a little different. Niimana is primarily attributive (§6.25a is representative), while ngarri is always either predicative or adverbial. A few examples were given above (e.g. in (6.17)).

(6.25)

a. Niimana boongginy arralabanjirr Ardiyooloon. Niimana boongginy a-rra-laba-n=jirr many eagles 1-AUG-have-CONT=1A.IO Ardiyooloon. One.Arm.Point

‘We have lots of eagles around One Arm Point.’ (GBL.004)

b. Niimana gooboolgoobool yardab irrin gooljon. Niimana gooboolgoobool yardab i-rr-i-n goolj-on. many caterpillars crawl do grass-LOC

‘Lots of caterpillars are crawling in the grass.’

(GBB.014)

Niimana can precede or follow the noun:

(6.26) “Nyoonoomardiny ngarlin aarlimay niimana,” injoon.

“Nyoonoo-mardiny ng-arli-n aarlimay niimana,”

there

1-eat-CONT food much

i-n-joo-n.

3-TR-do/say-CONT

‘“Over there I’ll have plenty of food,” he said.’

(MNJ.058)

The difference in semantics for the placement of niimana is very difﬁcult to determine (as is also true for other adjectives, demonstratives, and quantiﬁers with variable placement) but one possible generalization is that postnominal uses are less neutral. In the examples available, it seems than

274 Adjectives and Other Modiﬁers

when the adjective is postnominal, it is contrastive.108 In (6.26), for example, the speaker is deciding where to travel next, and he says that he will go back to his own country where he won’t be hungry, as opposed to his current condition, where he doesn’t have enough to eat. In that case, aarlimay niimana ‘much food’ is being implicitly contrasted with the speaker’s current state of hunger. Other examples of postnominal adjectives include examples where someone is exhorted to give guests just a little food, rather than aarlimayi niimana.
It can also be used with other adjectives:

(6.27) niimana arar aarli. many different ﬁsh ‘many different (species of) ﬁsh’

(MRR/BE)

Niimana can be used with both mass and count nouns; examples with count nouns are in (6.25) above, while (6.26) and (6.28) provide examples of niimana with mass nouns.

(L103.011)

In contrast to niimana, ngarri is adverbial; in addition to its uses with adjectives described above, ngarri can modify verbs, as given in (6.29). As noted above, ngarri often has the sense of ‘too much’.

(6.29) Ngarri mingankij, jiiborjiibor minjij. Ngarri mi-ngank-ij, jiibor-jiibor mi-n-j-ij. too.much 2-talk-PFV noise-REDUP 2-TR-do/say-PFV

‘You talk too much, and you make too much noise.’

Quantiﬁers 275

Finally, ngarrigij can be used adverbially, to denote how much a verb is done. It can also be used with the noun +moonggoon ‘knowledge’ to give information about how sure someone is about something.

(6.30) Arra nimoonggoon ngarrigij.

(JS: CB97.1/4:17)

2.3. ‘Many, much’: jalborr ‘few’ and alboorr(oo)

These two quantiﬁers are also adjectival. A few examples of jalboorr were given in (6.21) above. They are not speciﬁc to quantity but denote a few items and many items respectively. Like niimana, alboorroo can be used with both mass and count nouns.

2.4. ‘All, each’: irrgoord(oo)
Like boonyja, irrgoord ∼ irrgoordoo is glossed as ‘all’. The two words can be used together in a phrase, and irrgoordoo combines with many indeﬁnite pronouns (discussed in more detail in §12.3.7 below) to mean ‘any kind’; anggirrgoordoo, for example, is a compound of anggi ‘what’ and irrgoordoo and means ‘anything’.

Other compounds with ara include aralga ‘another day’ and arabooroo ‘another place’:

3. Inﬂection and derivation of modiﬁers
There are a few morphemes which appear to surface only on adjectives. None are productive.
3.1. Adjectival: -an
A sufﬁx -an is found on the word ardiyan ‘north-eastern’ (cf. ardi ‘northeast’), as well as a few other items. It may be related to the Jawi form of the allative case marker (§5.4.4), which is -an.
3.2. -jV (meaning unknown)
There are a few examples of a morpheme -jV which appears variably on adjectives such as booljarr ‘tired’, on the noun manyjal ‘hunger’ (when used predicatively, as in ‘he went to bed hungry’), and without any apparent difference in meaning on a few preverbs, including wirr ∼ wirrja ‘arise’ and joowara ‘sneak away’. The only set of examples where there appears to be any meaning difference is in the forms on manyjal ‘hunger’, where the sufﬁx appears on secondary predicates but not elsewhere. There are three forms in Laves, each with a different vowel (manyjalja, manyjalji, and manyjaljoo). These might be dialectal differences.

3.3. Predicative marker: =a
Adjectives, when predicative, take a clitic =a. It appears to be optional, in that only some speakers used it, and then not all the time. Examples are, however, well established in elicitation, and also found in narratives, such as (6.39). The sufﬁx also occurs on nouns, as discussed in §8.4.

3.4. English ‘one’: -wan
In the ﬁeld trips from 2008 and 2011, examples of the sufﬁx -wan occurred sporadically on Bardi adjectives. This sufﬁx is found on many adjectives in Kriol, and comes ultimately from English ‘one’ (as in the phrases ‘black one’ or ‘big one’). As seen from example (6.40), there is no number information

Numerals 279

conveyed in the sufﬁx. Example (6.40) also shows that -wan does not substantivize the adjective, since the adjective irrgirrgadarr ‘many’ is attributive to aarli ‘ﬁsh’.

4. Numerals
Like many Australian languages, Bardi has a small system of numerals; only 1, 2 and 3 are uniquely identiﬁed. Four is ‘2+2’ and ﬁve is ‘hand’ (although not everyone accepts this as a term for ‘ﬁve’). This is about average for Australian systems, though systems up to 20 are known from languages such as Gamilaraay in Central New South Wales (Ash, Lissarrague, and Giacon 2003).

4.1. Cardinal numbers

The Bardi numeral system is given in Table 6.2.

4.1.1. Elaboration of the system
These numbers can be combined to produce higher numbers in certain circumstances, but they are felt to be contrived, a way of counting that is not traditional. Further forms were given in a Bardi counting book but they were universally not accepted by older speakers. For numbers higher than ﬁve (and sometimes for ﬁve itself), English numerals are used. There are, however, occasional examples of numeral system elaboration in the Laves materials.

When English numerals are used, Bardi numbers are not; that is, there is no mixing of the two systems. Bardi also has a number of phrases from English numerals, such as ‘ten dollars,’ which are borrowed as single words (dindala).

4.1.2. Polysemy of arinyji ‘one’
The word arinyji is polyfunctional and polysemous. The other numerals, however, are used only as numerals. The word for ‘one’, however, can be used to mean ‘same’, and reduplication gives a distributive (‘each’) reading:
(6.45) Ngajana gandoorrman arinyjo booroo darr angarrarna. Ngajana gandoorrman arinyj-o booroo darr 1M.POSS countryman one-ABL place come a-ng-arr-ar-na. 1-PST-AUG-TR-pierce-REM.PST

‘He gave us lollies (candy)—one each.’

4.1.3. Numerals and vague quantiﬁation
While it has been claimed that numerals in Australian languages are ‘vague’ quantiﬁers, and refer not to speciﬁc quantities but to approximate amounts,

282 Adjectives and Other Modiﬁers

this is not true for Bardi.109 The quantities denoted by these numerals are not vague; irrjar means only ‘three’, not ‘three or a small number, several’. If one wishes to be vague about the exact quantity denoted, a compound gooyarr-irrjar ‘two-three’ is used.

‘We get two or three more.’

(GLN.006)

4.2. Ordinal numbers
No ordinal numbers appear in my data. Three words are translated as ‘ﬁrst’ in the dictionary, however they are not numerals. Alaboor ‘ﬁrst’ refers to the person ‘in front’ in a line, the ﬁrst item in a sequence, and contrasts with baybirr ‘behind’. Inngoorr ‘ﬁrst’ occurs in the sense of ‘before’, as in temporal ordering. Jorndi also refers to the ﬁrst item in a temporal sequence. Ajimarr is given as ‘second’ in Nekes and Worms (1953), but it also refers to relative location or position in a line and is not really a counting item. It also means ‘following’ (paralleled by the etymology of the English word ‘second,’ of course). It’s not a numeral because everything after the ‘ﬁrst’ item can be called ‘second’, including the last in the sequence.

4.3. Morphology on numerals
Numerals can take their own morphology, and this deﬁnes them as a word sub-class.

4.3.1. -nan ‘times’
There are examples of a sufﬁx -nan on numbers. It is also found occasionally on the quantiﬁer niimana ‘many’, so its use may once have been broader than my examples indicate.
(6.48) a. niimananan ‘many times’

Numerals 283

b. gooyarranan ‘twice’

Note that ‘once’ is different: the form is arinyjing, presumably with a form of the instrumental case (see further §5.3.4).

4.3.2. Numeric: -mara
Metcalfe (1975a) records a sufﬁx -mara which is used on loan numerals such as seven-mara. mara on its own means ‘far away’ but it is difﬁcult to see how this is related. My consultants did not use English numerals with this sufﬁx in Bardi.

Chapter 7 Pronouns and Demonstratives
This chapter outlines the free pronouns and demonstratives in the language. Pronominal categories are found in several places in the agreement and morphological system; these are summarized in (7.1). There are four types of pronouns: personal pronouns, emphatic pronouns, demonstrative pronouns, and interrogative/ignorative pronouns. There are free pronouns, afﬁxes, and clitics, which establish or cross-reference pronominal categories; they are listed in (7.1a). Only the free pronouns are discussed here; the other areas of pronominal reference are discussed elsewhere in the grammar.
(7.1) a. Personal marking
– free ‘absolutive’ pronouns (the absolutive stem is the basis for further case marking) §7.1;
– free oblique/possessive pronouns §7.4; – possessive sufﬁxing on nouns [transparently reduced forms
of free oblique pronouns]; – indirect object/oblique agreement on verbs [related to the free
oblique pronouns]; – subject agreement on verbs (see Chapter 9 and Chapter 10); – object/predicate agreement on nouns, verbs and adjectives; – possessive preﬁxing on nouns (see §7.5). b. Emphatic ‘pronouns’ [nimalgoyarr] §7.3 c. Demonstrative pronouns (§7.8) d. Interrogative/indeﬁnite pronouns (§7.6)
Third person pronouns of several types, particularly the singular pronouns, have several additional discourse functions in addition to anaphoric reference. Anaphoric use of free pronouns is less important than their other uses. They mark focus and topic status, for example, but are seldom used in reference tracking. Bowern (2008a) provides some earlier discussion, and these functions are described below.

286 Pronouns and Demonstratives
1. Personal pronouns
The evidence for pronouns as a word class distinct from nouns is not particularly strong. They do not show case marking paradigms distinct from nouns, for example. Their behavior in discourse shows properties of both nouns and pronouns, since most reference tracking is done with agreement or null anaphora rather than overt pronouns. They can take modiﬁers, just as nouns do (see §7.1.6). Like pronouns in other languages, however, they get their reference from the discourse context. Third person pronouns are also quite extensively used as determiners and modiﬁers of nouns. Person pronouns also have inherent number speciﬁcation, whereas nouns in Bardi do not. The free pronouns are also inherently referential, unlike nouns, and unlike agreement markers. Therefore while I treat personal pronouns as a distinct class here, one should remember that there are no morphological (and few syntactic) differences between nouns and pronouns.
1.1. Number distinctions in personal pronouns
The Nyulnyulan languages (including Bardi) and many other non-PamaNyungan languages of the Kimberley region are described as having a fourperson minimal/augment system, an analysis due to McGregor (1989a). McGregor (1989a) and Rumsey (1996) noticed several unusual facts about the pronominal systems of languages like Nyulnyul and Gooniyandi. These languages have (in familiar terminology) a ﬁrst person dual inclusive pronoun, but no ﬁrst person dual exclusive. The ﬁrst person dual exclusive is marked by the ﬁrst person plural. In many of the relevant languages there is no second or third person dual. Secondly, the ﬁrst person dual inclusive seems to pattern more with the ‘singular’ pronouns than with non-singular ones. In Bardi, for example, the ﬁrst person dual inclusive verb agreement is marked by a-, with no further number marking (cf. ﬁrst person ‘singular’ nga-, second person singular mi-, third person singular i-); the ‘plural’ persons all have a trill rrpreﬁx.110
The categories of 1AUG and 1+2AUG are collapsed in Bardi inﬂectional morphology and are marked by a single form (a derivative of arr-). This system is known as an Assiniboine system (after Greenberg’s (1988) typology of ﬁrst person dual marking). The Assiniboine system is schematized in (7.2).

Personal pronouns 287

(7.2) Assiniboine system
1min 1aug 1+2min
2min 2aug 3min 3aug

The alternative system, where all pronominal forms in the minimal/augment system are marked differently, is known as an Ilocano system. This is in evidence in Bardi only in the free pronouns. The Ilocano system is illustrated in (7.3).

1.2. Forms of pronouns

The forms of Bardi free absolutive pronouns are given in Table 7.1. The free pronouns follow the Ilocano system illustrated in (7.3) above.

3

ginyingg(i) irr

The minimal forms are used for reference to a single person, or for the dual inclusive in the case of the 1+2MIN form ayoo. The augmented forms add one or more additional referents to the minimal forms; thus the form arroodoo means ‘ﬁrst person and one or more third persons’ (i.e., ﬁrst person dual/plural exclusive). The 1+2AUG and 2AUG forms have multiple second or third person addressees; that is, the 1+2AUG arridil means ‘you and me and others who may or may not be addressees’.

288 Pronouns and Demonstratives

1.3. Usage

The pronouns labeled ‘absolutive’ are used in several contexts, which are summarized in (7.4) below:

(7.4) a. as the subjects of clauses, cross-referenced by subject agreement b. as the objects of clauses, cross-referenced by object agreement c. as the indirect/oblique objects of clauses, cross-referenced by oblique agreement d. as coreferential with possessive pronouns e. as vocatives f. third persons are used as number/deﬁniteness markers

Examples follow; (7.5a) shows a subject (marked by ergative case and cross-referenced by the subject pronoun nga-), (7.5b) is also a subject but of an intransitive verb. (7.6a) shows a copula clause, (7.6b) shows a direct object, (7.7a) an oblique, and (7.7b) a possessor doubling a possessive pronoun.

b. Ngayoo jana gandoorrman. Ngayoo jana gandoorrman. 1MIN 1M.POSS country.man

‘He is my countryman.’

The absolutive pronouns are also used in a subcase of possessive marking in (7.9e) below, where the possessor is marked on the noun itself as a preﬁx, and the free pronoun is coreferential (but does not receive additional marking).
As far as can be determined, there are no differences in register in using personal pronouns; that is, it is not impolite or disrespectful to address someone directly as joo ‘you’.
Pronouns can be modiﬁed by the emphatic use of =ninga ‘name’, as in joo=ninga ‘hey you’, or ngay=ninga ‘it’s ME! (see (7.8))’; in such cases, speakers vary as to whether =ninga receives person agreement. Most of the examples show it without agreement, as just quoted, but joo=nyinga, with the second person minimal agreement preﬁx, is also found. Impressionistically, agreement is more common with ﬁrst person uses (ngay=nganga) than with other persons.

1.4. Case marking on pronouns

The pronouns take the same case afﬁxes that appear on nouns, for which see §5.2 and following. Morphologically, there is a difference between the source case -joon and the locative -goon on the ﬁrst person pronoun ngay(oo); the form of the ﬁrst is ngayoon, and the second is ngayon. This is regular, if we assume that glide-ﬁnal stems take vocalic allomorphs, not consonantal ones. Case on the ﬁrst item in the phrase ensures that there are all possibilities for case marking. This gives the inﬂectional form. It is a little unclear if all case inﬂections are licit if the pronoun is the head of the phrase, due to semantic restrictions. For example, animate referents do not take instrumental case marking as heads of phrases. (7.9) gives examples of each of the main Bardi cases attached to a personal pronoun. Comments follow.

(Lative) (Directional) (JS: June 19. 2008)

In (7.9c), two forms are possible; both ngayoong and ngaynga were judged acceptable. The ﬁrst uses the vowel-ﬁnal allomorph of the pronoun, while the latter uses the consonantal one. In general, the speaker (JS) from whom these sentences were elicited prefers citation forms without ﬁnal vowels; other speakers vary considerably in whether the ﬁnal vowel of the ﬁrst person is present or absent.

1.5. Conditions on appearance/use of free pronouns

Pronouns are never, to my knowledge, syntactically obligatory in the clause. They are not used for reference tracking, as shown in (7.10) for example, where argument continuity is inferred by the absence of free NPs or pronouns and the subject marking on the verb provides information about which participants. Context identiﬁes the referent of the verb agreement.

(GAL1.061)

Personal pronouns 293

(7.10) contains no argument NPs or pronouns at all; the only NPs are place names or locations.
Even in cases of potentially ambiguous argument tracking, free NPs or pronouns are seldom used. The ambiguity is tolerated, though there is some assumption of argument continuity (that is, that subjects continue subjects and objects continue objects); however, likelihood and real world knowledge are used to infer who is doing what. Conﬁrmation of the ambiguity in such cases arose in working through the Laves materials from the 1920s with different speakers. It was not always possible to recover who was doing what from the syntax alone.
Most of the other cases where pronouns might be syntactically obligatory in other languages are not found in Bardi. Heads of relative clauses, for example, can be omitted. (Further discussion is in §16.7.) Both speech act participants can be omitted. Subjects and objects of gerunds can be omitted, even though they are not cross-referenced on the verb (see further §11.3). In Bowern (2008a) I argued that arguments in raising constructions must be expressed. That is, in examples such as ‘I saw the woman walking on the beach,’ the NP ‘the woman’ could not be omitted. This appeared to be the case from my elicited data, but similar examples exist in the older materials where there is no overt material representing the raised argument. In (7.11), from the Laves materials, there is no free noun phrase or pronoun in the relevant clause.

(7.11) Barna booroo injalarna darr inarna, injalanirr.

3-TR-see-REM.PST=3A.DO

‘He saw him coming; he saw them.’

(L81.049)

This may have been a change in the language, or simply an artifact of the elicitation situation. Further discussion of this topic can be found in §16.5.1, where I discuss evidence for possible differences between verb serialization, subordination, and parataxis.
Pronouns (or free nouns) which are part of a coordinated phrase cannot be omitted:

(7.12) Monty, Lionel agal ngayoo angarrjarrarra barda Broomengan. Monty, Lionel agal ngayoo a-ng-arr-jarrarra barda Broome-ngan. M. L. and 1MIN 1-PST-AUG-get.up away B.-ALL

‘Monty, Lionel and I got up and went off to Broome.’ (LOM.020)

There are, however, pragmatic conditions on the appearance of free noun phrases, though these apply to nouns as well, and not just pronouns.
There are differences among persons for when the free pronouns appear. First and second person pronouns are largely conﬁned to clauses where the involvement of the speech act participant is especially highlighted; in (7.13), for example, the speaker is singling out the recipient as the person who should be doing the activity.

‘You tell him to stop here! He doesn’t listen to me.’

Many examples also involve a contrast in participants, although this does not necessarily trigger free pronoun use.
Pronouns cannot be omitted if the argument is in focus. But if they are in special focus (Kiss 1998), they may also get reinforcement, such as with the exclamative arra, as shown in (7.14).

Personal pronouns 295
Third person pronouns are different from ﬁrst and second person pronouns. While they can be used to signal focus, they also have functions which do not involve focus. The third person plural irr is used to mark number in NPs, for example (see §5.1.1).
The third main use of free absolutive pronouns is in conjunction with the series of possessive pronouns (for which see §7.4 below). Although it is possible to use the possessive pronouns without an accompanying absolutive pronoun, it is more common for the absolutive pronoun to appear. If the pronoun is absent, the possessor tends to migrate either to the verb or to the possessum.
(7.16) Jiiba joo jiya, nyoonba ara baawa jina.
Jiiba joo jiya, nyoonba ara baawa jina. this 2MIN 2M.POSS that other child 3M.POSS
‘This one here is for you. That one there is for the other kid.’

1.6. Pronominal modiﬁcation

Pronouns may be used with numerals in examples such as (7.17). In such examples, however, it is difﬁcult to know what the head of the phrase is, since there is both pre- and post-head modiﬁcation.

(7.17)

a. Irr irrjar barnmiidan ingarrjarralana. Irr irrjar barnmiidan i-ng-arr-jarrala-na. 3AUG three that.way 3-PST-run-REM.PST

‘Those three ran that way.’

‘There’s their guts too, the small intestine and the large (bitter)

intestine—both together.’

(NRM.008)

The problem of deﬁning the modiﬁer and the modiﬁed element is well shown in (7.17b), where it looks like both the third person minimal and augment

296 Pronouns and Demonstratives

pronouns together are used in the same phrase. This could be a speech error, however. In all these cases, the pronoun precedes the numeral. When pronouns are marking number in a noun phrase more generally, they can precede or follow the head noun.
While numerals above one are mostly of the form irr ‘3AUG’ and the numeral, there are occasional examples of a numeral above ‘one’ combining with the third person minimal form ginyinggi.
(7.18) Ginyinggi irrjar barni ingoorroongoorribini Jimijanyji.
Ginyinggi irrjar barni i-ng-oorr-oo-ngoorribi-ni Jimijanyji. 3MIN three around 3-PST-AUG-TR-chase-REM.PST J.

i-ng-arr-jarrmi-na.

3-PST-AUG-arise-REM.PST

‘The three pieces of mangrove wood lifted up.’

(JLN2.009)

The difference between irr and ginyinggi in such sentences is the topic of future research.
Pronouns can be modiﬁed by jiiba ‘this’, as in (7.20):

(7.20) Bijiiba boor anjala bardaga moongangan, ngayoo jiiba boor ngankala aron bardaga.

Bijiiba boor

a-n-jala

bardaga moonga-ngan, ngayoo

jiiba boor

this look.around 1-TR-FUT-look-FUT another-LOC tree

‘You look around here in this tree for sugarbag, and I’ll look around

there in the other tree.’

(Dictionary)

In this case, jiiba gives a deixis reading, where the placement of the two people are in contrast.
Pronouns can also be modiﬁed by adverbs such as minyjin ‘only’. Such adverbs follow the item they are modifying.

1.7. Pronouns as modiﬁers

The ﬁnal function of personal pronouns is anaphoric, as modiﬁers in a noun phrase, though this is not their primary use. Some examples were discussed brieﬂy in the previous section. This modiﬁcational use is mostly conﬁned to third person minimal and augment pronouns. They may precede or follow the noun they are modifying. The difference between these two positions is unclear. In (7.22), the phrase balili ginyingg is an afterthought construction, co-referential with baawa ‘child’ (balili is an initiation grade). This example shows a postposed pronoun, while (7.23) shows an example where the pronoun precedes the noun.

2. Predicate markers

Free pronouns are not generally reduced or cliticized to other constituents in the clause. There are, however, a set of predicative pronouns, which are clitics. They are most commonly found as direct object markers on verbs, and that function is discussed in detail in §10.3; however, they can also be used in some other situations. The forms are given in Table 7.2.

Table 7.2. Direct object forms

1MIN 2MIN 3MIN 1+2MIN 1AUG 2AUG 3AUG

Set I
=ngay =rri =ø =way =moord =goorr =irr ∼ =rr

Set II
=jarrngay =jirri =ø =jarrway =jarrmoord =jarrgoorr [=irr, =jarrirr, =jirrirr]

In addition to their use on verbs to mark direct objects, the predicate clitic pronouns can also appear on predicative adjectives, where they agree with the subject, as in (7.25), which shows a ﬁrst person example.

(7.25) Ngay moorrooloomarrngay.
Ngay moorrooloomarr=ngay. 1MIN little-SEMB=1MIN.PRED

(7.26) (Joo) niiwandigijarri.

(joo) niiwandi=gija=rri. 2.MIN tall=VERY=2M.DO

‘You’re very tall.’

The predicate markers can also appear on predicative nouns such as +moonggoon ‘knowledge’ in examples such as (7.27).

Predicate markers 299

Arra nyoo-ngoo=jarrngay. NEG 2-stomach=1M.DO

‘You don’t like me.’

(BGM.006)

Finally, these clitics can be used as clitics on free pronouns, in which case they add ‘emphasis.’ In (7.28), the speaker (Jessie Sampi) is giving the evidence that Bardi people have always lived in Bardi country. The text shows a high number of emphatic constructions which contrast Bardi people, especially the people of Mrs Sampi’s generation, with others.

‘Us people, my sisters and cousins, we know the stories. . . .’ (BDI1.004)

For simplicity, the forms given in Table 7.2 are glossed as DO (for ‘direct object’) even in the contexts, such as those illustrated above, when they appear on a predicate other than a verbal one. The same principle applies to the glossing of ‘oblique’ markers, discussed in §7.4 below, which have functions other than indirect and oblique object marking.

3. Emphatic pronouns

There is no special series of emphatic pronouns; the free pronouns themselves convey a degree of emphasis by virtue of their presence. Unemphatic pro marking is null and carried by the verb agreement. Most of this ‘emphasis’ can be subsumed under a deﬁnition of unexpected information, information which is contrary to expectations, or exclusiveness (that is, that out of a set of possible referents, it is that one only that is meant).
Besides the regular pronouns, there are four ways that one can add emphasis to a pronoun. One is the use of the direct object/predicate clitics; an example was given in (7.28) above. Second, one can use the clitic or free word =ninga in conjunction with a regular pronoun. It means literally ‘name’, though in examples such as (7.29) below, it is bleached. We could perhaps assume in such contexts that the pronoun has an exhaustive or exclusive listing interpretation (that is, where the pronouns serve to emphasize that the particular participants in the action of the predicate are those ones and no one else).

(7.29) Ar aamba ginyingg ninga.
Ar aamba ginyingg ninga. other man 3MIN NINGA

‘This was one man.’

(L63.003)

The third emphatic form is (=)goyarr, either used on its own (in the Laves materials) or in the pronominal item nimalgoyarr ‘himself/herself’. The form is discussed in §12.3.1.2 because it is most commonly used in constructions where English uses a reﬂexive pronoun (as in ‘he did it himself’), and in other reﬂexive constructions where the speaker is emphasizing that an action is done other than by the person’s own volition. It is not, however, a genuine reﬂexive pronoun, since it does not reduce the valency of the clause and can also stand as the subject of a clause. The form is recorded both as a clitic and as an independent word.

‘“I don’t know . . . ,” he thought to himself.’

(JMI.027)

Finally, a form for ﬁrst person only, ngaybi, is found in the exclusivity reading (that is, where the pronoun prefers speciﬁcally to the ﬁrst person only, and no one else). In (7.31), for example, the sense of the sentence is that if the speaker drowns, the addressee will also drown (whereas if someone else drowns, that won’t happen).

(7.31) Ngaybi nganggarda joo biilamb ngayarda.

‘If I drown, you’ll drown too.’

(BA-CB52.3/BE)

4. Possessive and oblique pronouns
The other set of free pronominal forms (apart from the free absolutive pronouns discussed above) is the set of oblique pronouns. They are used in possession constructions and a few other places, to be discussed below. Bardi free possessive pronouns take possessum agreement. The person marking in the possessive is different from the free pronouns; the possessives show an Assiniboine system, where there is no distinction in clusivity in the augmented forms (see Table 7.2 above). In this they are like afﬁxal agreement.
4.1. Forms
The Bardi free possessive forms are given in Table 7.3. The free pronouns may also be used as clitics; those uses are discussed in §10.4 below.
When the free possessor pronouns are used as possessives, they take the form of compound pronouns, which specify information for the person and number of both possessor and possessum. Thus if there is a ﬁrst person possessor and a third person augmented possessum, the form of the pronoun is jan-irr. The third person minimal possessum form is null; thus jina means ‘his/her/its (minimal) thing.’ Final vowels are optional on all the free possessive forms, and are deleted when a vowel-initial possessum marker follows,

except for the second person minimal possessor/third person augment possessum, which is jiyarr rather than expected jiyirr. The forms are predictable, so full paradigms are not given here.
The 1MIN and 1+2MIN forms have short and long variants, ngajana and jana for the ﬁrst person minimal and ajowa and ajawa or jawa for the 1+2 form. These forms are presumably contractions of the free pronoun and the possessive pronoun.
Free possessive forms are used both as pronouns (as in (7.32a)) and in marking possession where the noun is overt, as in (7.32b):

(L139.021)

(7.35) is a good example of a form of the pronoun where both possessor and possessum are non-third person, and therefore clearly show the person agreement in these pronouns.
I am agnostic about whether the compound possessive/possessum pronouns represent genuine compounds, afﬁxation, or cliticization of the possessum marking to the possessor pronoun. There is no way to distinguish between these analyses that I can determine. I gloss the forms as afﬁxed because of forms such as aala=jana-rr=irr in (7.35) above, where the compound possessive =janarr is followed by a third person augment predicative clitic =irr. The hyphen for the third person augment possessum indicates that -rr is bound to =jana rather than to aala.

304 Pronouns and Demonstratives

4.2. Possession sufﬁxation

Possessive pronouns can cliticize to the possessum; in this case, they can show lenition, although it is optional. When the possessor cliticizes to the host noun, it does not show agreement with the possessum. They tend to occur with kinship terms, although not exclusively so. They are found more extensively in the Laves materials than in modern Bardi materials.

(7.36)

a. bo=yin woman’s.child=3M.POSS ‘her son/daughter’
b. gool=an father=1M.POSS ‘my father’

These pronominal clitics are found frequently on kinship terms in the Laves materials, and appear to be the default way of signaling possession in these items. They can also occur on body parts.

5. Possessive preﬁxation

As mentioned brieﬂy in §4.2.1.1, Bardi has a set of nouns which inﬂect for possessive preﬁxation. The forms of the possessive preﬁxes are given in Table 7.4.

‘The man’s name was Ngoolmoongoolmoo.’

(L71.20)

6. Ignorative/interrogative pronouns
Bardi has a set of pronouns which could be best labeled ‘ignorative’ (the term is due to Wierzbicka 1980), in that they have dual functions of the indeﬁnite and interrogative. The forms and associated semantics are discussed here; the syntax of question formation (which can include strategies other than the use of an ignorative pronoun) is discussed in Chapter 15. Some ignorative pronouns can also be used in indirect questions; such uses are further discussed in Chapter 16.
6.1. Forms
The ignorative pronouns do not form a neat paradigm. There are some roots which can be identiﬁed (and reconstructed to Proto-Nyulnyulan in many cases) but there is also extensive fossilized morphology. Table 7.5 gives the forms of ignorative pronouns in the language.
There are two words glossed as ‘why’: angan and anggi. Angan is probably not an ignorative in the true sense of the term, since unlike the other pronouns discussed here, it does not appear to have an indeﬁnite (but noninterrogative) meaning. Anggi can mean either ‘what’ or ‘something’ in different circumstances, but to my knowledge, angan only means ‘why’, not ‘some reason’. There is also goonban(kij), which also forms questions about reasons why, but differs from the others in that it expresses the speaker’s disbelief and disapproval that the interlocutor could have done what they did. It means something like ‘why on earth. . . ’ and further discussion can be found in §15.4.2.2. The word nganyji in isolation is a particle which is used in one way of marking polar questions. It may also combine with other elements in the ignorative system (see further §15.4.1).
When used in isolation, the ignoratives have either interrogative or indefinite readings. However, several of the roots in Table 7.5 can combine with

Nganyjal is also found, however it is only used in the ignorative system when combined with irrgoordoo, where it means ‘how many’. On its own, nganyjal means ‘hopefully’.

6.2. ‘Who’ and ‘what’: anggi-
Most Nyulnyulan languages have a single pronoun yangg(i) which means both ‘what’ and ‘who’. Bardi has innovated a distinction between anggi

Ignorative/interrogative pronouns 307
‘what’ and anggaba ‘who’. The sufﬁx -ba in this form is probably etymologically the cleft/relative clause marker. The development would thus parallel French qu’est-ce que . . . ?, literally ‘what is it that . . . ?’. Unusually, the ergative case marker can be omitted from anggaba; I assume that this is a reﬂection of its status as a former clefted pronoun (if the pronoun is clefted, we would not expect it to receive ergative case marking because it would not be part of the same clause as the verb). There are examples with anggaba-nim, however all the examples are from the modern corpus. There are no examples from the 1920s. Alternatively, it is possible to use anggi-nim ‘what/who-ERG’ in the meaning of ‘who’, instead of using anggaba without the ergative case. An example of this is given in (7.40).

6.2.1. Interrogative uses

Examples of ‘who’ and ‘what’ are given in (7.39). (7.39a) shows that anggi can also be used with nouns to mean ‘what kind of’, in the sense of what species.

With the word ‘name’, either anggi ‘what’ or anggaba ‘who’ can be used:

b. Anggaba ninga jarri aamba? Anggaba ni-nga jarri aamba? who 3-name this man

‘What’s this man’s name?’

It is not uncommon in Australian languages for the interrogative ‘who’ to be used in questioning a person’s name.
The pronoun anggi is also used in some idiomatic expressions, such as (7.42).

(7.42) Angginim inarligal?
Anggi-nim i-na-rli-gal? what-ERG bit

‘What happened? [What bin happen?]’

(NI, conversation)

Anggi is also used in asking questions about the purpose of an action. It is one of several different ways of asking ‘why’ questions; reason questions are formed with angan, for which see §15.4.2.2 below. The use of anggi here in Bardi is parallel in Nyulnyul to the use of the equivalent question word marked with the dative case; since Bardi has no dative case, the form is uninﬂected.

6.2.2. Indeﬁnite uses

The previous examples of anggi and anggaba involved the interrogative uses of the pronoun. There are also indeﬁnite uses, where the pronoun is best translated as ‘something’.111 The form can be either anggi or anggal (see (7.46)), which is overtly marked for the indeﬁnite reading.

6.2.3. ‘What’s it’: anggooriny
The pronoun anggoriny is both indeﬁnite and interrogative; it is clearly derived from anggi ‘what’ but the sufﬁxal morpheme is not otherwise attested.

310 Pronouns and Demonstratives

It is used most often when the name of something is forgotten, or occasionally, taboo in speech. In (7.47), for example, anggooriny is standing in for an item whose name is gender-restricted and which cannot be used in mixed company.

6.2.4. ‘Whatever (all)’: anggirrgoordoo

Another indeﬁnite pronoun formed from the root anggi is anggirrgoordoo ‘whatever’. It would appear to be a compound of anggi and irrgoordoo, which on its own means ‘everyone’, which is found in conjunction with several ignorative roots. In (7.48), for example, anggirrgoordoo is used several times in David Wiggan’s description of the populating of Noah’s ark.

Note that anggirrgoordoo can take minimal agreement marking, as it does in (7.48).

Ignorative/interrogative pronouns 311
6.2.5. ‘Why so much’: anggarriny
The ﬁnal derivative of anggi is anggarriny ‘why (do X) so much?’. The sufﬁx is unknown and not found on other items.
(7.49) Anggarriny ngaakon minjoo. Marl anja! Anggarriny ngaak-on mi-n-joo. Marl a-n-j-a! why.so.much talk-LOC 2-TR-do quiet 2-TR-do/say-FUT ‘Why are you talking so much? Be quiet!’ Anggarriny minjididing?

6.3. ‘Where’ and ‘which’: jana

The second root found in the Bardi ignorative system is jana, which on its own means ‘which (one)’. It also combines with booroo ‘place’ in the word janabooroo or janambooroo ‘where’. There appears to be no difference in meaning between the two forms. This word can be further inﬂected for local cases such as the allative and ablative. The root jana is also sometimes used on its own in the meaning ‘where’ (e.g. (7.50)), but this is less common.

(7.50)

a. Janangan arr mindan? Jana-ngan arr mi-n-d-an? where-ALL go 2-TR-do/say-CONT

Janabooroo-ngan arr mi-n-d-an?

where-ALL

go 2-TR-do/say-CONT

‘Where are you going?’

The ﬁrst question implies an answer which is a place name (not a general location); this is in contrast to janambooroo ‘where’ which has no such implication, and can be answered with either a place name or a general direction

312 Pronouns and Demonstratives

term. This implies that jana on its own still has a lot of the sense of ‘which’ and there is a gapped noun meaning something like ‘place (name)’.
‘Where to’ and ‘where from’ are marked by the allative and ablative cases respectively.112 For static location, a form uninﬂected for locative case is used. The locative does not combine with janambooroo.

The case placement here indicates that janabooroo ∼ janambooroo is a compound and not a phrase. Such a compound also exists in the Laves materials. These texts from the 1920s, however, also contain overtly phrasal uses of jana and booroo. An example is given in (7.52), where jan=arr shows one of the ‘emphasis’ clitics identiﬁed in Metcalfe (1975a).

Ignorative/interrogative pronouns 313

The word for ‘which’ is jana. It cannot be felicitously used on its own to mean ‘which [one]’; compare the following exchange:

(7.53)

a. Anggaba jin

banigin?

who 3sg.POSS cup

‘Whose cup is this?’

b. Jana *(banigin)? which (cup)

(Intended: ‘Which cup?’)

(conversation, 2003)

In the exchange in (7.53) (which happened on a camping trip) a speaker (me) attempted to use jana ‘which’ without a head; in this case jana was interpreted as ‘where’, which was not a clear answer (and not taken to be pragmatically equivalent to ‘which’).

6.4. ‘How’: nyirra- and nyirroogoordoo

The basic meaning of nyirra is ‘how’. This pronoun is used to ask the manner in which something is achieved. It can also be used for ‘how come’ questions, that is, questions that ask about the reasons of something, or the manner in which something is achieved.

(7.54) Wiliwili nyirra irrjimbinjanirr ngayoo?

ﬁshing.line how 3-AUG-die-CONT=1M.POSS=3A.DO 1MIN

‘How come my ﬁshing lines are there for nothing? (lit, ‘how come my ﬁshing lines are dead on me?’)’

A more common form than nyirra is nyirroogoordoo. It is used in the phrase nyirroogoordoo minkal ‘how are you?’ (lit. ‘how are you living?’)113 This appears at ﬁrst sight to be nyirra marked with the proprietive derivational marker -goordoo, for which see §5.1.6 above. However, if this is the case, we would expect lenition of the sufﬁx to occur; that is, we would expect the form to be *nyirrorda rather than nyirroogoordoo. A more likely alternative is that it is a haplological compound of nyirra and irrgoordoo.

Nyirroogoordoo can also be used for tides to ask about the state of the tides (that is, whether they are ebbing or ﬂowing, or how far up the tide has come). In such cases, the question in (7.56) is equivalent to anggi gaarra ‘what water?’

(7.56)

a. “Gaarra nyirroogoord a-n-d-an?”

‘It’s going into the mangroves soon.’

This interrogative pronoun is used to question the quality of something. It thus serves as another test for a difference between nouns and adjectives. The answer to a question with nyirroogoordoo is an adjective, but the answer to a question with anggi ‘what’ is a noun.

(7.57)

This ignorative root is found in the complex predicate nyirra -joo- ‘do what’? This is the closest form that Bardi has to an interrogative verb. It is

Ignorative/interrogative pronouns 315

found mostly in the Laves corpus, but occasional examples are also found in more modern texts.114

‘I’ll be getting thirsty, what am I going to do?’

(L145.011)

Also in the Laves materials is the word nyirrard or nyirrada. It could be a form of nyirra with the privative case (see §5.1.5), which is not used in Modern Bardi, but is attested in the Metcalfe materials. This might be an allegro form of nyirra arra ‘how not’, though it does occur three times in the corpus and so is likely to be a real form. It is immediately preverbal in all examples in Laves. In modern speech the form nyirra arra is used instead.

(L150.008)

We ﬁnd some other derived forms of nyirra- with one or two examples each. Bessie Ejai uses nyirra-gonyi ‘how-LAT’ in the lative case in (7.60).

(7.60) Nyirragonyi boordoo ngankam?
Nyirra-gonyi boordoo nga-n-ka-m? how-LAT proper 1-TR-FUT-put

‘Where should I put it.’

(BE)

There is also a form nyirrirrgoordoo, which is found only in Laves in sentences such as (7.61):

316 Pronouns and Demonstratives

(7.61) Ginyinggon “nyirrirrgoordoo minama borlayii,” ingirrinina.

3-PST-AUG-TR-do/say-REM.PST

‘Then they asked “what happened to your brother?”’ (L131.028)

This form adds weight to the assumption that nyirroogoordoo in Modern Bardi is an allegro compound of nyirra and irrgoordoo rather than a stem inﬂected with the proprietive.

6.5. ‘How long’ or ‘how many’: nganyji-

The root nganyji is a question particle which marks polar interrogatives. In combination with irrgoordoo, however, it means ‘how long,’ ‘how many,’ or ‘how much time’. Both nganyjirrgoordoo and nganyirrgoordoo are recorded in the corpus, the latter being found mostly with men recorded by Aklif and Metcalfe.

6.6. ‘When’: baanigarr

We can reconstruct a root *baani ‘when’ for Nyulnyulan languages, however in Bardi the only form for ‘when’ in the language is baanigarr, which means ‘when’ or ‘what time’.

7. Indeﬁnite pronouns

As noted above, Bardi has ‘ignorative’ pronouns (Wierzbicka 1980); that is, the interrogative pronouns are also used as indeﬁnite, negative, and free choice pronouns. The indeﬁnite uses of the ignorative/interrogative pronouns were discussed in the previous section. However, Bardi also has other items which can be used in indeﬁnite pronominal functions, and these are described in this section and summarized in Table 7.6. Remember also that ignoratives can be used in this function and are not listed here.

Table 7.6. Indeﬁnite pronouns

Bardi ambooriny anggabaniimal ooldoobal almiidan anggooboor

English anyone something something anywhere somewhere

Note lit. ‘person’

It should be mentioned that the numeral arinyj(i) ‘one’ is not used for indeﬁnite marking. It only means ‘one’ and cannot have a non-speciﬁc or indeﬁnite reading.

Indeﬁnite pronouns 319

7.1. Null marking

The ﬁrst question is whether null marking (that is, agreement alone) may be indeﬁnite. One problem with describing ‘ignoratives’ and indeﬁnite pronouns in texts is that it is sometimes unclear what the assumptions of the speaker are regarding shared information. In recording oral historical narratives, for example, I was recording texts which were well-known to the audience, even if they were not well-known to me. Likewise, in the Laves texts, it is unclear what the information currency was behind the stories on the page. The ﬁrst sentence for text 78 begins like this (example (7.69)):

(7.69) Ingarrana goorlil aranganim aamba.

I-ng-arr-a-na

goorlil aranga-nim aamba.

3-PST-AUG-TR-[give]-REM.PST turtle others-ERG man

‘Other men gave someone turtle.’

(L78.001)

In this sentence, the recipient of the turtle is unmarked. It appears that null marking can be used for indeﬁnites. It is possible to background participants enough that they are omitted entirely. In this Bardi is different from some other languages with extensive null anaphora, such as Warlpiri, where omitted items are always shared knowledge. My elicitation data on this point are conﬂicting. In some cases speakers were adamant that null marked forms were not ‘complete’ unless there was an overt noun phrase, or that they were used only in cases where the participant was known. On the other hand, there are many examples in texts and free conversation which would argue against this. In (7.70), for example, the point of the question is that pregnant women are not allowed to be present at the particular ceremony that is about to be performed. Thus the point is not whether any speciﬁc person is pregnant, but whether there is a (non-speciﬁc) pregnant woman in the audience.

(7.70) Oongoolinyarr injoon ingarraybayboon boonyjanim ambooriny.

Oongoolinyarr i-n-joo-n

i-ng-arr-aybayboo-n

pregnant

3-TR-do/say-CONT 3-PST-AUG-ask-CONT

boonyja-nim ambooriny.

all-ERG people

‘They all asked if anyone was pregnant.’

(L81.002)

320 Pronouns and Demonstratives

I tentatively assume that null marking may be used if the reference of the participant is either known through shared common ground in discourse, or if the reference of the participant is unimportant. This would explain the apparent difference between the elicited sentences and discussion, and the examples in text and observed conversation. Since I was asking about participants in the elicitation, that presumably created a context where the participant reference became important, thus destroying the conditions for felicitous omission.
A further use of null marking is where the noun is omitted, and an adjective or other derived modiﬁer is used alone. An example is given in (7.71) where ambooriny-marr person-SEMBL means ‘something like a person’.

(7.71) Nyoon injalanan amboorinymarr jigir injoona bardaga niimoonggoolon.

‘He climbed out of the marsh and saw something like a person peep-

ing out of a tree trunk.’

(JMI.012)

7.2. Other indeﬁnite markers

The word ambooriny ‘person’ can also be used to signal an indeﬁnite speciﬁc referent.

(7.72) Ngoorra inanggalajarrngay amboorinynim. Arra ngamoonggoon oorany o aamba, maankaninga boora.

‘Last night someone sneaked up on me. I don’t know if it was a man or woman—it was really dark.’

In negative contexts, the form arrajin(a) ‘no one, nothing, no one’ is used.

A further indeﬁnite form is anggabaniimal is used. This is literally a compound of anggaba ‘who’ and niimal ‘nose’.

322 Pronouns and Demonstratives

8. Demonstratives and deixis markers

The ﬁnal set of pronominal forms are demonstratives. I consider the demonstrative forms in Bardi to belong to the same system as other pronominal forms. The demonstratives have a textual and spatial deictic function. There are two levels in the system: proximal and distal. Deictic markers can be static or dynamic. The deixis markers can be divided into those that contain an element of motion and those that do not. The deixis markers may also be used adverbially. These are listed here but are further discussed in Chapter 14. The relevant forms are given in Table 7.7.

The demonstratives are based on two stems, with b- forms marking proximal forms and ny- on distal ones. Neither the stem nor any other part of the word is synchronically analyzable, however.
Bardi people also use hand and face gestures to point, in conjunction with (or instead of) deixis markers. For older people, lip pointing (pursing lips and

Demonstratives and deixis markers 323
moving the head slightly in the direction of pointing) is the most common pointing method. Hand pointing is also used.

8.1. Demonstratives

Demonstrative pronouns such as jiiba and jarri mark old information; jiiba ‘this’ also contains information on proximal deixis. Jarri seems to be primarily an anaphor, whereas jiiba seems to be primarily a deixis marker. Items marked with jiiba have to be visible to both speaker and hearer, whereas this is not true for jarri. The form jiiba is recorded with both a long and a short vowel. Examples of both follow in (7.76)–(7.77). Jarri could also be characterized as marking information which is presumed to be shared between speaker and hearer.

NPs with jiiba tend to be new or focused information and thus appear ﬁrst in the clause. It is not a requirement, as there are examples of jiiba in other positions, but the majority of examples show jiiba as occurring ﬁrst. Examples with jarri tend to occur in absolutive contexts (either subjects of intransitive clause or objects of transitive ones). There is no syntactic prohibition on jarri in transitive subject position but its rarity in the corpus is striking. When it

Demonstratives and deixis markers 325

does occur, it tends not to take the case marker; that is, jarri is one of the rare exceptions to case marking occurring on the ﬁrst word of the phrase (see further §8.5.2). There are examples, however, where jarri is both ﬁrst in the phrase and the host for case marking; (7.76b) is an example. Jarri is a literal marker of deixis. That is, the referent of jarri can be established independently of the discourse context.
Two words are translated as ‘that’; they are nyiinba and nyoonba. They are both distal demonstratives. Neither is particularly common in my corpus, with ten examples each. The difference is said to be dialectal, with nyiinba being Jawi and nyoonba Bardi.

8.2. Deixis markers

The demonstratives discussed in the previous section also have a deictic component. There are also two words—biiji(ba) ‘this’ and nyoonoo ‘that, there’— which are purely deixis markers.

326 Pronouns and Demonstratives
When there is multiple deixis, everything up until the furthest item away is marked with the proximal marker.
The deixis marker boona or boonoo is rare in the corpus and, when it does appear, is usually not translated by speakers. It is glossed as both ‘this’ and ‘that’ and there are not enough examples to determine its function. When asked about this word, BE glossed it as nyoonoo and gave examples that implied it had the same meaning as nyoonoo. Another speaker said that boonoo was a Jawi dialectal form, and that it meant the same as nyoonoo. From the Laves materials, where it is glossed as ‘pointing to a short distance’, there is some indication that it may have represented a third level of (distal) deixis in the system, but modern Bardi speakers use just two levels.

Chapter 8 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax
This chapter describes syntactic phenomena at the level of the noun phrase that have not been detailed in the previous chapters. I describe the evidence for a noun phrase, its composition, interaction between modiﬁers, nominal predication, and review evidence for considering case marking as case, rather than postpositions, as has been argued for other Nyulnyulan languages. I do not distinguish a NP from a DP in this grammar, since I lack the relevant data to do so. It is quite possible that such a distinction would be useful in the analysis of Bardi and the relationship between agreement marking and number marking, for example, or the syntax of pronominals used as determiners (described in §7.1.7 above) to mark number. Bardi also appears to have interactions between nominal and determiner order and deﬁniteness. These interactions are a topic of future research.
This is the ﬁrst of three chapters on syntactic and conﬁgurational topics, and division of material between them is at times somewhat arbitrary. In this chapter I particularly focus on topics that are relevant to noun phrases and their constituents. In intra-clausal syntax (Chapter 15), focus is on the clause, constituents within it, and major clause types such as questions, and phenomena which affect the whole clause, such as negation. In Chapter 16, I move to ways in which clauses (and some phrases) can be combined.
1. Evidence for a noun phrase
The left edge of a noun phrase is well deﬁned, since case marking occurs as a sufﬁx to the initial word of the NP. §8.5.2 gives some examples, and this demarcation of the phrase edge is quite consistent in my data (with a few minor and systematic exceptions noted below). The right edge of the phrase, however, is less easy to determine. For the most part, the noun occurs last in the phrase; that is, noun phrases are usually head-ﬁnal. There are, however, a number of exceptions to this generalization. One instance is where material appears to be part of the noun phrase, but follows the noun. Adjectives and pronominal markers, for example, can precede or follow the noun. Second is where the noun itself is omitted, and the phrase consists only of an adjective.

328 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax
The third difﬁculty for constituency is where the noun phrase is discontinuous.
Standard tests for constituency primarily involve substitution, omission, and movability. That is, a group of items in a clause are a constituent if they may be replaced with another item (such as a pronoun), if they may be gapped, and if they may be moved as a single unit (Payne 1997). Such tests are difﬁcult to apply in Bardi. Movement tests are inconclusive, since constituent order is discourse based (see Chapter 15). Substitution and omission tests produce ambiguous results. One test is that constituents form answers to content questions. Consider, however, the data in (8.1). In (8.1a), the possessor and possessive pronoun are the answer to the question ‘what do you want?’ In (8.1b), however, the answer is the possessive pronoun and the possessum (the thing being possessed).
(8.1) Anggi liyan minman?
Anggi liyan mi-n-ma-n? what want 2-TR-put-CONT
‘What do you want?’ a. Lenanim jin.
Lena-nim jin. L.-ERG 3M.POSS
‘Lena’s.’ b. Jiya banigin.
Jiya banigin. 2M.POSS cup
‘Your cup.’
Now, these cannot both be constituents, unless we assume that in each case there is a null argument (the possessum in (8.1a) and the possessor in (8.1b)) and that both the sentences in (8.1) are examples of an NP, rather than a lower-level phrase.
Movability tests are difﬁcult to apply because Bardi allows some discontinuous phrases. In (8.2), for example, all sentences are grammatically equivalent, though they have different pragmatic entailments. In the ﬁrst, there is focus on ‘two’ (that is, he speared two ﬁsh, not three); in the second, there is a neutral reading, while in the third, the implication is that ﬁsh were speared, rather than, for example, stingray.

Evidence for a noun phrase 329

c. Aarli inamboona gooyarra.

Aarli i-na-m-boo-na

gooyarra.

ﬁsh 3-TR-PST-spear-REM.PST two

Some of these topics are discussed in more detail at the clausal level in Chapter 15. While discontinuity is allowed, the patterns of discontinuity found in the data are quite constrained. They are free enough, however, to interfere with substitution and movement tests for constituency.
Some arguments can be made, however. First, since case is only marked once per phrase, noun phrases in general must exist in Bardi, otherwise there would be no general prohibition on multiple constituents receiving case. Moreover, when transitive subject phrases are discontinuous, they usually receive two case markers:

(8.3) Boordijinim innyana alinggoonoonim barnimi booroo ingarralana.

Boordiji-nim i-n-nya-na

alinggoonoo-nim barnimi

big-ERG 3-TR-catch-REM.PST rainbow-ERG around

booroo i-ng-arr-ala-na.

look 3-PST-AUG-look-REM.PST

‘A big rainbow caught [her] and they looked around.’ (L160.016)

This implies that they belong to separate phrases. However, this is not universal in the corpus. There are also examples (though they are less numerous) where two discontinuous elements are clearly to be interpreted together, but only one exhibits case.
Secondly, the number of modiﬁers in a noun phrase is quite constrained. When modiﬁers are found in the data, there is usually only one, and never more than two. Attempts to elicit multiple modiﬁers of different types were not successful.115 We should not expect this to be the case if there is a ﬂat structure within noun phrases (or no evidence for a noun phrase at all).

330 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax

Conjunction tests also provide evidence for a noun phrase. Modiﬁed nouns can be conjoined with single nouns, as in (8.4) and (8.5) below:

(8.4) ginyinggijina aamba agal goowa
ginyinggi=jina aamba agal go˙owa 3MIN=3.POSS man and mermaid

‘that man and mermaid’

‘When she ﬁnished, then he taught her all the stuff about men’s business, all the things that women and children don’t know about.’
(L113.007)

However, even conjunction data are not entirely straightforward. Consider (8.6), where the conjoined names Ngoonyi and Ooloowa are discontinuous; the object is split by the verb.

(8.6) a. Garnkarnnyarra Ngoonyi ingarrarrbarrboon agal Ooloowa ngar-

(L137.001)

Order and number of modiﬁers 331

spear.tip 3-M.POSS-3AUG

‘They slept and in the morning they got up, and ﬁxed all their

spears and spear points in the ﬁre.’

(L155.006)

Thus in such cases either we assume that different types of phrases can be conjoined (in which case we have no test for constituency at all), or that phrases can be discontinuous.116
Thus in summary, we do have evidence for noun phrases in this language.

2. Order and number of modiﬁers
2.1. Types of modiﬁers in a noun phrase
The modiﬁers which are possible in a noun phrase are given in (8.7). They are unordered in this list; ordering discussion follows.
(8.7) a. adjectives b. demonstrative and personal pronouns c. quantiﬁers d. possessors e. numerals f. derived modiﬁers (e.g. adnominal uses of case) g. place adverbials h. relative clauses
The syntax of relative clauses (including evidence for their ambiguous status as embedded within an NP or adjoined to it at a higher level) is discussed

332 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax

in §16.7. Relative clauses follow the head noun, and may be separated from it.
As mentioned above, there are no good examples of nouns with more than two modiﬁers. There is a single example with three, given in (8.8) below:

(8.8) goolboo arinyji moorrool jin-irr rock one little 3M.POSS=3A ‘his single little rocks’

(L156.001)

In this example I assume that arinyji means ‘single’ rather than ‘one’ because of the augmented number marker on the possessor, though I do not have any other examples of arinyji ‘one’ with augmented marking. This example is from the Laves texts, which occasionally show evidence of errors in dictation (for example, subject-verb agreement errors where Laves has clearly either skipped a word in transcription117 or the speaker rephrased the sentence). It cannot be certain, since this is the only such example, that it is not a transcription artifact.

2.2. Positions for modiﬁcation

We can identify three positions in the noun phrase beyond the head. These are a possessive phrase, a pre-nominal ‘modiﬁer’ position, and a postnominal modiﬁer position. Both the prenominal and postnominal modiﬁers can comprise an adjective (underived or derived through case marking), quantiﬁer, or numeral. Since numerous examples of such orders appear in the grammar already, further examples are not provided here.

(8.9)

Elicited examples with multiple modiﬁers were permitted, but equivalent examples were not found in spontaneous speech. For example, (8.10) shows four adjectives modifying lali ‘lolly’ (= ‘candy’); the prompt was a suggested description for licorice sticks. Jessie Sampi accepted the adjectives in any order.

(8.10) boordiji niiwandi ngooboo maanka lali big long soft black lolly ‘big, long, soft, black, lolly’

Order and number of modiﬁers 333

If the noun is possessed, it does not also co-occur with a number-marking pronoun (though it may occur with other demonstrative and deictic modiﬁers).
Possessive phrases may occur either in front of or following the head noun. Within the possessive phrase, the (elidible) possessor NP and the possessive pronoun may occur in either order. The usual order is Possessor > Possessive Pronoun > Possessum. An example of the alternative order is given in (8.11). It is not known what determines the order in such phrases.

(8.11) moowarn jinirr jiwarra

moowarn jin-irr

jiwarra

hair

3M.POSS-3A corpse

‘the corpse’s hairs’

(A1939a)

In all but one example in the corpus, the possessor phrase is outside of any other modiﬁers of the noun. In one example, however, a numeral precedes the possessor:

(8.12) gooyarrnim jinirr malarr

gooyarr-nim jin-irr

malarr

two-ERG 3M.POSS-3A wife

‘his [Arriyana’s] two wives/ both of his wives’

(GRR2.011)

The relevant character in the story (arriyana ‘wedge tail eagle’) has only two wives, so the phrase cannot mean ‘two of his wives;’ I assume it means ‘both;’ that is, the speaker is foregrounding the two wives’ acting together.
There is one intriguing dictionary example where the possessive pronoun is ﬁnal, following both possessor and possessum:

(8.13) Ngayoo jamoo balbarr jana.

Ngayoo jamoo

balbarr jana.

1MIN mother’s.father bald 1M.POSS

‘My grandfather is bald.’

(Dictionary)

Let us turn now to other types of modiﬁers. In prenominal position, I have examples of two modiﬁers of different types (and also nouns modiﬁed by more than one adjective, such as (8.10) above). These occur in several different orders. Representative examples are given below.

2.3. Postnominal modiﬁcation

Adjectives may precede or follow, although out of the blue (e.g. in elicited sentences) there is a prohibition on the Noun Adjective order. For example, (8.18) was judged ungrammatical out of the blue.

In examples with post-nominal quantiﬁers in §6.2, it was noted that the difference between prenominal and postnominal quantiﬁers appeared to be whether the quantiﬁer was contrastive or not. That is, in the relevant examples, postnominal modiﬁcation was used when ‘much food’ was being explicitly contrasted with ‘no food’. The ordering of modiﬁers in Bardi would also probably ﬁt an analysis where the ordering reﬂects restriction; prenominal modiﬁers would be neutral or restrictive, while postnominal modiﬁers would be non-restrictive. It would also explain why such orders—as illustrated in (8.18)—are unacceptable in isolation, since they would be occurring

336 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax
in a position where the referent of the nominal had not yet been established in discourse. It is also noteworthy in this regard that the overwhelming number of examples of postnominal modiﬁcation occur when the relevant noun is not initial. This would be expected if the modiﬁers are being used nonrestrictively and the reference of the nominal is already established in discourse.119

2.4. Headless noun phrases

As discussed elsewhere, modiﬁers such as adjectives, quantiﬁers, and numerals can appear without a head noun. (8.21) provides an example with an adjective. These examples are not particularly common and are only found when a head noun is clearly recoverable from discourse context. That is, adjectives do not automatically acquire nominal status when used without a head noun.

3. Discontinuous and multiple Noun Phrases

Discontinuous noun phrases are disfavored in isolation and in elicited sentences. They do appear in texts, however, particularly with a quantiﬁer and a noun, as illustrated in (8.23). (8.22) was rejected as an elicited sentence, although equivalent sentences do appear in narratives.

Discontinuous and multiple Noun Phrases 337

3.1. Constraints on discontinuities

There are two common patterns among discontinuous noun phrases. The most well attested (in fact, the only well attested type) is where a verb splits an NP which contains a quantiﬁer and a noun. (8.24) provides two examples, one with an object and the other with a subject. In the latter example, the noun is marked for ergative case but the numeral arinyji ‘one’ is not; this is unusual; more often (as in (8.3) above, for example) both elements in a discontinuous case-marked noun phrase would be marked.

(8.24)

‘They came as a raiding party; one spear woke them up.’ (L102.038)

The alternative order, where the noun is ﬁrst and the quantiﬁer is second, is also found, but is much less common. Example (8.27) below has a further example of a discontinuity, although in that sentence the case is on the preverbal numeral rather than on the head noun, and (8.30) has the NP and numeral in the opposite order.
The second type of discontinuity is where one part of the Noun Phrase is at the front of the clause, and the rest of the NP is elsewhere (usually late in the clause). In (8.25), for example, the head of the NP jawal ‘story’ is ﬁrst in the clause, while the possessive phrase is ﬁnal.

‘I’ll tell a STORY about my husband.’

(AMB1.001)

3.2. Afterthoughts

A further area of apparent discontinuity occurs in afterthought constructions. These have different intonational properties from the other types of discontinuity already discussed. The afterthought (wiliwiling ‘with a ﬁshing line’ in (8.26)) occurs in its own intonational unit and is often separated by a pause.

‘I caught myself on my hook—on [my] line.’

3.3. Secondary predication

Bardi has secondary predicates. The typical order is illustrated in the ﬁrst clause of (8.27), where the subject is ﬁrst and the secondary predicate (here, jooloonjoona ‘raiding party’) is last in the clause.

(8.27) Garandi Ngarlgoony nyalaboo arr inggirrina jooloonjoona, niiman aamba ingarrjarrmina irr gooyarranimi ingarragoolina aamba.

Discontinuous and multiple Noun Phrases 339

The only examples I have of any number are depictive secondary predicates. They are all absolutive arguments, though I do not know if that is a syntactic constraint or simply reﬂects the small number of examples. Two further illustrations follow. Note that by far the largest number of instances of this construction comes from the Laves collection.

‘He went to sleep hungry and the next day he went again into the

bush for poison.’

(L73.010)

(8.29) shows also that a few secondary predicate nouns (and adjectives) have a sufﬁx -ji ∼ -j (a similar presence or absence was noted on preverbs in §13.6.7.3).
I assume also that naming constructions are instances of secondary predicates. In this case, the form of the construction is usually X, Y ‘name’ (X with the name Y), as shown in (8.30).

(BE: CB51.2)

4. Nominal predication

Predicate nominals (including nouns and adjectives) can take a clitic =a. In (8.32) we see (in (a)) that the citation form is boorrboorriidi ‘dancer’. In the (b) sentence, however, the ﬁnal vowel of the stem is replaced by =a. The same is true in (c), where the subject and predicate are in the opposite order. In the (d) sentence the intensive marker =gij is added to the predicate, which still takes =a.

Syntax of case marking 341
No similar clitic is noted for other Nyulnyulan languages. It is optional, though it is not known what governs its appearance, and not all speakers use it.

5. Syntax of case marking
The morphology and semantics of Bardi cases were thoroughly treated in §§5.2–5.5, and some mention was made in §5.2.2 that for most of the other Nyulnyulan languages, the case markers have been analyzed as postpositions (see e.g. McGregor 1994b, 1998, in press). The analysis has implications for Bardi’s place in head/dependent marking typology (Nichols 1986). If Bardi has postpositions, it is clearly a head marking language and would have very little dependent marking. If the language has case marking, however, we would analyze Bardi as being of mixed type. In this section I take up this question in more detail. I also provide an overview of case in the noun phrase and in the clause, and thirdly describe the constraints on multiple case marking.

5.1. Cases or postpositions?

There are several criteria we can use to decide between free adpositions and afﬁxes (or clitics). These are given in (8.34) and are based on Zwicky and Pullum (1983) and Anderson (2005:33).

(8.34)

a. What are the relevant native speaker judgments about wordhood for the items in question?
b. What constraints are there on the host? (Clitics, but not afﬁxes, can be attached to material already containing clitics.)
c. What type of alternations to the markers exhibit? d. Do they have a high degree of selection with respect to their
hosts? e. Do they exhibit paradigmatic gaps? f. Do they show idiosyncratic semantics? g. Is the host + marker combination subject to lexical rules? h. Are there syntactic rules that affect the host + marker combina-
tions?

342 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax
The answers to these questions give us mixed results; distributionally, the markers appear more like adpositions, with one per phrase in a ﬁxed position (second in the phrase). However, on most of the remaining criteria, they appear much more like case markers, where the noun and the case form a single word in phonology, morphology, and syntax.

5.1.1. Native speaker judgments
I asked three native speakers of Bardi at different times about words and what formed a word. They were quite consistent in their answers. In Bardi, there are words that are grammatical on their own (e.g., n-alma ‘his/her head’), there are words that mean something on their own but need another word before or after them to allow them to be interpreted (clausal clitics like =min ‘and then’, as well as most preverbs, were in this category) and ﬁnally there are items that aren’t a word on their own. Most of these items were unrecognizable to speakers until they were placed in the appropriate inﬂectional context. For example, the verb root -jiidi- ‘go’ was not recognized, but inyjiidigal ‘he/she went’ was recognized.
Case markers were also systematically not recognized as either words or as items which meant something but needed a host to make them sound ‘complete’. For example, goona ‘backwards’ is a word, and so is goonamadan, but madan isn’t anything on its own. This is good evidence that case markers are not free words or clitics.

5.1.2. Constraints on the host

Bardi case markers can be attached to bare nouns, and (in certain very limited circumstances), to items which already have a case marker (see further §8.5.3 below). They may not, however, be attached to a word which contains a clausal or phrasal clitic.

(JS: BOW-FN.12, 2011)

As has been noted already in several places, the case marker appears on the ﬁrst word of the phrase. This order makes the case look rather like an adposition distributionally. It is very rare in the world’s languages; Dryer (2011) ﬁnds only seven examples, all of which are languages spoken in Australia.120 However, languages which mark all items in a noun phrase for case are, according to Blake (1994:100ff), in a minority in the world’s languages. Languages where case marking is predominantly phrasal (but inﬂectional) are found all over the world, including Tocharian, Quechua, and Kannada (Blake 1994:101). The Bardi realization of case on the initial element does not, therefore, automatically exclude it from consideration as afﬁxal.121 Anderson et al. (2006) discuss two cases (Nias Selatan and Kuuk Thaayorre) where case is marked phrasally, but by morphology which is sensitive to the lexical item to which it attaches. That is, these languages show phrasal marking where the marker has all the properties of word-level inﬂection (rather than clitics or adpositional words). I argue that Bardi is another case of such a phenomenon.

5.1.3. Allomorphy
Case markers participate in phonological alternations that clitics do not. These alternations were described above in §3.6.2. A sample noun with case marking and a clausal clitic is given below.

344 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax

(8.38)

a. Gooljiman-ko Kooljaman-ABL
b. o˙olo < o˙ola-go water-ABL

cf.

(8.39) Oolagid inarij. O˙ ola=gid i-n-ar-ij. water=THEN 3-TR-pierce-PFV

‘Then it started raining.’

Bardi clausal clitics, for the most part, do not show lenition, and those that do have different patterns. When clitics lenite, they usually lose their initial stop completely. They also do not participate in vowel coalescence and the formation of a mid vowel o; this is a feature of afﬁxal lenition and is found in both verbal preﬁxal morphology and in case markers.
Furthermore, remember from the discussion in Chapter 5 that some allomorphy is unpredictable; that is, there are optional applications of lenition which are governed by the particular lexical item. Consider the forms in (8.40). In the ﬁrst case, lenition does not apply where we would expect it to, while in the second, it applies even though the relevant phonological environment is not present.

(8.40)

a. gaarra-goon sea-LOC (instead of the predicted *gaarron, cf. goron < gaara-goon ‘sand-LOC’)
b. marnanyon reef-locative (instead of *marnanykon)

Finally, some nouns take null locative marking (a list is given in §5.4.2.3 above). This class is also lexically deﬁned.
This sort of allomorphy is much more reminiscent of afﬁxation than of postpositions. That is because it is lexically speciﬁed; the individual lexical item determines the form of the case marker, and these forms are idiosyncratic. Since cliticization is a post-lexical phenomenon (Anderson 2005:33ff), lexical phonological rules should not be applicable. As Anderson (2005:34) puts it, ‘Elements introduced in the lexicon . . . can behave differently in construction with different lexical items, while elements introduced postlexically (clitics) have no opportunity to refuse selectively to appear . . . or to make item-speciﬁc modiﬁcations of form or content.’ This provides evidence that Bardi case markers are afﬁxes. Further evidence is given in the next two sections.

Syntax of case marking 345

5.1.4. Reduplication

A similar argument for the application of lexical rules to case-marked forms comes from reduplication. Reduplication patterns were discussed in §3.8 above. One of the patterns of reduplication involves the whole word. When case-marked words are reduplicated, the case marker is reduplicated too:

(8.41) Ginyinggonkid irrol innyanajin inamboonoogid irrolongirrolong. Ginyinggon inyjarralana layoordoo barda.

Ginyinggon=kid irrol i-n-nya-na=jin

3-TR-PST-spear-REM.PST=THEN spear-INS-spear-INS. Then

i-ny-jarrala-na layoordoo barda.

3-PST-run-REM.PST spirit away.

‘Then he got his spear, and speared him again and again. Then the layoordoo spirit ran off.’

(8.42) Injarrbarrboonirr booroonganbooroongan.

I-n-jarrb-arrboo-n=irr

booroo-ngan-booroo-ngan.

3-TR-send-REDUP-CONT=3A.DO place-ALL-place-ALL

‘He sent them all off to their own homes.’

(M.Dict)

This also provides evidence that the noun and the case marker act as a single word, both in the syntax and for the purposes of further morphological inﬂection and derivation (such as reduplication).

5.1.5. Idiosyncratic semantics
There are items in Bardi which appear with either frozen case markers (that is, where the marker is felt to be part of the stem rather than a separate afﬁx), or where the addition of case marking produces unexpected semantics. A good example of the latter comes from comitative marking, where some kinship terms form dyads with the comitative, while for others, the meaning is compositional.
(8.43) a. gooloo-nyarr ‘father-COM’ = ‘with a father’

346 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax
b. goli-nyarr ‘father’s mother-COM’ = grandmother-grandchild dyad’
A further example is marrga-nyarr ‘murderer’ (lit. ‘shield-COM’).
5.1.6. Arguments from codeswitching
Another argument for the wordhood of case markers and their hosts is that when Bardi speakers codeswitch from English into Bardi, they tend to use Bardi case markers as well as English prepositions. This is further (though not uncontroversial) evidence that the markers are part of a single phonological word.
(8.44) ‘. . . and he bin carry’im that far, I tell you, from Oombinarr-go O-ABL
right up Janawan hill.’
(8.45) [Who bin get’im that barnamb?] ‘Anggaba-nim, Jandi-nim bin poke it.’ [Who bin get’im that barnamb?] ‘Anggaba-nim, Jandi-nim bin stingray someone-ERG Sandy-ERG poke it.’ spear
(‘Who got that stingray? What’s his name, Sandy, speared it.’)
In the ﬁrst example, the place name receives ablative case marking, even though there is already a preposition ‘from’ in the clause. In the second, the subject of ‘poke’ gets ergative case, even though English does not mark ergativity.
5.1.7. Nascent adpositions
Finally, it looks as though Bardi is developing adpositions of a sort, from locational adverbs and other items. The locational adverbs are discussed in §14.2.1 below. The locational adverb appears adjacent to the case-marked noun phrase in the vast majority of cases; in the example of boogon ‘inside’, 38 out of 42 instances involved the adverb being adjacent to the NP. Of the

Syntax of case marking 347
cases where it was adjacent, it preceded the NP in 27 cases and followed it in 11 cases.
(8.46) Balaboo loolool ingarrgardinana boogoon bangalon baawagid nyoonoo daag injoonoo.
Balaboo loolool i-ng-arr-gardi-na-na boogoon bangal-on here enter 3a.pst-enter-pst.cont inside reef.crevice-loc baawa=gid nyoonoo daag i-n-joo-noo. child=then here sleep 3sg.pst-do.
‘They went inside the crevice in the reef and the child went to sleep.’
Some examples of words that behave this way are boogoon ‘inside’, jimbin ‘inside under’, lordony ‘underneath’, and bornko ‘around’.122
Items such as the ‘adverbial’ nascent adpositions in Bardi are also found in a few other Australian languages. In Iwaidja, for example, Pym and Larrimore (1979:161) describe a set of relator-axis phrases, where a noun combines with an adpositional item. In Iwaidja, items appear to be either preposed or postposed without variation; in Bardi, however, the same words can appear in either order.
5.1.8. Conclusions
Thus in summary, Bardi case is morphological case, not post-lexical adpositional marking. Case-marked words show different phonological rules from cliticized ones. Cases are subject to lexical selection criteria, which clitics are not. They show idiosyncratic semantics and paradigmatic gaps.
I do not have the information at present to determine whether the arguments made here apply also to other Nyulnyulan languages. The markers are mostly cognate (though there has been some semantic shift in some items; for example, the Western Nyulnyulan instrumental is cognate with the Eastern Nyulnyulan comitative). There are differences in case use among the languages; for example, Warrwa (McGregor 2006a) and Nyikina (Stokes 1982a) have focal ergative marking, where the ergative shows features of a discourse marker; this use of case marking is largely absent from Bardi.

348 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax

5.2. Case positions in the clause

With a few well-deﬁned exceptions, Bardi case marking is a second position phenomenon; that is, the case marker is attached to the end of the ﬁrst element of the phrase regardless of word class.

The examples in (8.47) (repeated from (5.44) above) illustrate the principle of second position with the ergative case. There are, however, a few very

Syntax of case marking 349
minor exceptions to this rule. The exceptions to strict second position are of three types. Almost all my exceptional case marking occurs with the ergative. I do not know whether this is because of any fact about ergative marking, or because the ergative is the most commonly attested case. Exceptional case placement could not be explored through elicitation, because it is a colloquial speech phenomenon which speakers correct when it is pointed out.

5.2.1. Names
In the ﬁrst instance, a few items do not ‘count’ as position-making constituents. Names with titles borrowed from English are treated as a single unit for the purposes of case inﬂection, for example; the case marker goes on the name, not the title.
(8.48) Mr. Crusty -nim. -ERG
It is not clear that names with titles are fully analyzable as multiple words, since they have a single stress (on the ﬁrst syllable of the title) and the people tend to be always referred to with their title. That is, it’s as though the name is [mistakrasti]. I therefore do not consider these a real exception to the case placement rule.

5.2.2. Demonstratives

The second exception of this type involves the demonstrative jarri ‘this’, which may modify a noun in an NP. When it does, and when it occurs ﬁrst in the phrase, its ergative marking is optional. Either the ergative appears on jarri, or it appears on the following noun, as in (8.49).

350 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax

It remains to be seen whether such items are truly exceptions. It is possible that in these examples, jarri is adverbial rather than pronominal; alternatively, it could be referring to the object (in which case it would not be part of the subject NP at all). This is unlikely, since intonationally jarri often goes with the following noun. In such examples, jarri is almost procliticized to the following noun. There are examples of jarri taking clausal clitics, however:

(8.50) Jarrigid aamba goonab roowil innyana.
Jarri=gid aamba goona=b roowil i-n-nya-na. this=THEN man back=REL walk 3-TR-catch-REM.PST

‘This is the man who walked back.’

(M1939A.056)

This remains an exception, and a puzzle for further research.

5.2.3. Adnominal case-marked nouns

The third class of exceptions involves adnominal case marking. An adnominally case-marked noun may either receive further case marking, or the marking may be on the following noun (see further §8.5.3 below):

(8.51)

a. ooranynyarrnim aamba . . . oorany-nyarr-nim aamba . . . woman-COM-ERG man
b. ooranynyarr aambanim oorany-nyarr aamba-nim woman-COM man-ERG

Such examples require further investigation. Since the comitative case may be used both phrasally and adnominally, it is not certain that the two phrases in (8.51) have the same meaning. The ﬁrst means ‘the married manERG’, but it is not known whether the second also means ‘married man’, with adnominal use of the comitative, or whether it means ‘the man-ERG with the woman.’ In the latter case, the comitative-marked noun would not be part of the subject noun phrase.123

Syntax of case marking 351

5.2.4. Conjunction

Finally, nominal conjunctions sometimes cause ambiguity in case marking placement. Full noun phrases can be conjoined, in which case both items usually receive case marking, as in (8.52).

However, in some cases, only one of the conjoined nouns receives case marking. Sometimes it is the ﬁrst, while in other cases, it is the last.

Syntax of case marking 353
Speakers differ in how grammatical they ﬁnd such sentences. The sentences in (8.54) came from Nancy Isaac, but other speakers preferred either to put case marking on both the nouns or to rephrase so that one noun was in the comitative.

5.3. Multiple case marking

Bardi does not show the multiple case exponence that has been described for Australian languages such as Martuthunira and Kayardild (Blake 1994, Dench and Evans 1988, Evans 1995). A few examples are found, however. The ﬁrst is the potential compound case marking described in §5.4.3. All other instances of multiple case involve interactions of different constituent levels. That is, it is possible for an item to receive both adnominal and phrasal case marking (or adnominal and clausal case, if the noun is in an inﬁnitival clause).

(8.55)

Adnominal and phrasal:
a. Jiidinyarrnim aamba inangajimgal. Jiidi-nyarr-nim aamba i-na-ngajim-gal. beard-COM-ERG man 3-TR-[PST]-hit-REC.PST

‘Then the child was born (lit. ‘fell’) when they put out the ﬁsh poison

for the ﬁsh.’

(WIR.032)

One other example is where the possessive pronoun is marked for case, such as in (8.57). The usual order in such examples is that the case marker

354 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax

precedes the possessive pronoun (see (5.146) on page 241 for an example). In (8.58), the possessive pronoun appears to receive both locative and allative case marking. This particular type of case stacking is only possible when there is a possessive pronoun; it is not found on nouns (though see §5.4.1.2 for further discussion of multiple case marking in local cases). This implies that one case marker is associated with the pronoun, and the other with the noun; that is, that the structure of (8.58) is [booroo=[jirr-on]-ngan], and that the phrase might be translated literally ‘to the place at theirs’.

(8.57)

Angginimal inarlingay ngoorra malbarra jonon.
Anggi-nim-al i-n-arli=ngay ngo˙orra malbarra what-ERG-INDF 3-TR-bite-1M.DO last.night buttock jon-on. 1M.POSS-LOC

(8.58)

‘Something bit me on my bottom last night.’ . . . booroojirronngan. booroo=jirr-on-ngan. house=3A.POSS-LOC-ALL

‘to their place’

(conversation, many examples)

An alternative analysis would be to assume that the possessive pronoun is no longer a clitic in such constructions, but has rather become afﬁxed to the noun. There is some evidence for this, since in the Laves materials, possessive ‘enclitic’ pronouns show lenition, at least when attached to kinship terms (compare bo-yin ‘her child (woman’s.child-3M.POSS’)). However, as (8.58) shows, modern speakers do not use lenited possessive forms here. I leave the clitic vs. afﬁx status of the possessive markers as an open question.

6. Possession
Just as Hosokawa (1991:§6.2.2) noted for Yawuru, in Bardi the term ‘possession’ covers a wide range of semantic relationships between two lexical items, including true possession, alienable and inalienable, copyright, kinship, a topic of a story, as well as other meanings. These are signaled with several different types of morphology. The morphology of these strategies has been discussed elsewhere, but in this section I provide an overview of the semantics and syntax of the different strategies of possessive marking.

Possession 355
6.1. Overview of marking strategies
There are ﬁve ways in which possession is marked. The ﬁrst is with a possessive pronoun; these forms were given in §7.4 above. This is the most general type of possessive marking. The second is that a subset of inalienable nouns take possessive preﬁxes; these were given in §7.5. Thirdly, the comitative case -nyarr may be used for certain types of attributes; the semantics of these were discussed in §5.5.1. Fourthly, a possessive pronoun may be cliticized to the verb; this alternates with a free possessive pronoun. Finally, there is also an independent verb -laba- ‘hold, have, possess’, which can also mark possession.
In the following sections, I discuss recursion, possessor/possessum feature marking, and alienability. There is, to my knowledge, no difference in possession dependent on permanence; that is, both temporary possession (such as ‘I have $10’) and permanent possession (‘I have two shoulders’) are marked in the same way.

6.1.1. Recursive possession

Bardi allows recursive possession. Up to three possessors have been recorded in a row; some examples with two are given below.

(8.59) Ngayoo jana galoongoordoo jina booroo, goolooniman jina booroo, ngayoo jana booroo biila.

Ngayoo jana galoongoordoo jina booroo,

mother’s.mother 3A.POSS namesake

‘My grandchildren have the same names as their grandmother.’ (lit. ‘my grandchildren’s grandmothers are their namesakes.’)
(Conversation, 2008)

6.1.2. Number and person marking in possession

Possessive pronouns are marked for the number and person of both the possessor and the possessum. Most common in the corpus are examples with a third person augmented possessum, but examples such as (8.61), with a ﬁrst person possessum, show that the possessum is marked for person as well as number.

(8.61) Arra goolarrjargajan ngay joogarrangay gooloo.

Arra goo-l-arr-jarg-a=jan

ngay

NEG 2AUG-IRR-AUG-be.frightened-FUT=1M.IO 1MIN

joogarra-ngay go˙oloo.

2A.POSS-1M father

‘Don’t be frightened of me, I’m your dad.’

(BE: CB52.2)

Augment marking may be omitted from the possessive pronoun if the possessum is non-individuated. This is the same condition under which augmented direct object marking is omitted (for this see §10.3 below).

(8.62) Barda ingirriloonganana maanka aambooriny jirr baawa.

Barda i-ng-irr-iloonga-na-na

maanka aambooriny

away 3-PST-AUG-pick.up-CONT-REM.PST black people

jirr

baawa.

3AUG.POSS child.

‘They used to take away black people’s children.’ (Aklif 1994d:12)

In the case of the inalienable possessive markers, however, the number of the possessum is not expressed. That is, forms such as nga-marla ‘1M-hand’ can mean both ‘my (one) hand’ and ‘my (two) hands’.

Possession 357

6.1.3. Alienability in possession

Although Bardi has a set of preﬁxes for nouns which are inalienably possessed, not all items which are semantically inalienable take them. The items which do take the marking are mostly body parts, but they also include words like +nga ‘name’ and +ngarrarda ‘shadow’, and a few properties such as +jarra ‘taste’:

(8.63)

a. gorna niyarra gorna ni-yarra good 3M-taste
b. arra irr-jarra arra irr-jarra NEG 3A-taste
‘It’s tasteless.’

Other items which are inalienable do not take the preﬁxes. Only about half the body parts take them, for example; others, such as langana ‘shoulder’ and gaanyji ‘bone’, take regular possessive pronouns. Kinship words also take regular possessive marking.
Bardi does not have the appositive possessive construction that is found in a number of Australian languages. In this construction, the possessor pronoun is in the same case as the possessed item. It is particularly common with body parts, as this example from Yawuru illustrates; for an overview and discussion see McGregor (1999:429ff).

(8.64) Yawuru

Ngaji juyu marru nyily mi-ny-ju-n? INTER 2MIN head headache 2-do/say-CONT

‘Do you have a headache?’

(Hosokawa 1991:428)

In such examples in Bardi, either a possessive pronoun or an inalienable preﬁx is always present.
Possessive pronouns may also cliticize to the noun denoting the possessum, in which case the j- of the stem shows lenition:
(8.65) boyin < bo-jin ‘woman’s child =3M.POSS

358 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax

Possessive cliticization is found particularly with kinship terms. Its full range has not been determined in the language. There is a striking asymmetry in distribution, in that although possessor and possessum can occur in any order, and although the possessive pronoun fairly frequently occurs after the noun when the possessor is gapped, only with kinship terms is the possessive pronoun regularly cliticized to the possessor.
Finally, possessors may be marked on the verb. In this case, there is no possessum person/number marking (to my knowledge) in the free noun phrase. In (8.66), for example, the third person minimal possessive clitic =in refers to the culture hero Jo˙oloo. The literal translation of the sentence is ‘They—his [sons]—danced for them.’

(8.66) Boorrboorr ingirrinjirrirrin.

Boorrboorr i-ng-irr-i-n=jirrirr=in.

dance

3PST-AUG-do-CONT=3A.IO=3M.POSS

‘They [Jooloo’s sons] danced for them [the people from Jalan].’ (BA-CB41/MD)

6.1.4. Non-literal possession

Possessive constructions can also be used in metaphorical or non-literal possession, or possession of attributes. For example, stories or songs which are ‘about’ someone or something are described with possessive pronouns:

(8.67)

a. boorroo agal larrood jirra

jawal

kangaroo and hermit.crab 3AUG.POSS story

‘a story about a kangaroo and hermit crab’

(BLJ.001)

b. Nawayoon jawal gardiliny jina.

N.

story monkey.ﬁsh 3M.POSS

‘Nawayoon (a way of catching monkeyﬁsh) is a story about monkey ﬁsh.’

To my knowledge, only the possessive pronouns are used in this construction. Attributes can be marked with any of the possessive pronouns, comitative
case, or inalienable preﬁx.

Possession 359

(8.68)

a. gorna niyarra gorna ni-yarra good 3M-taste
b. ngarri jina laya. ngarri jina laya. much 3M.POSS fat

‘He’s got a lot of fat.’ = ‘He’s fat.’

c. Iila biila roowil innyana barda ngalganngalannyarr.

‘The dog also walked off with [his tail] wagging.’ (DRK.071)

6.2. Use of a full verb

There is also a verb, -laba-, which is used to mark possession.

(8.69)

a. Roowil ingirrinyana nyalaboo garda “Warday angganim ila-

banirr jardirri bo!” ingirrinajirri.

360 Noun Phrases and Their Syntax

It is used where physical possession or holding is literally meant, especially in the Laves materials. Most of my own examples mean ‘have’ or ‘possess’, and ‘hold’ or ‘grab’ is denoted by -inya- ‘catch’. This is true for all the examples in (8.69), for example. (8.70) shows an example where the sense of ‘holding’ is literal.

Chapter 9 Verbal Predicate Structure
In the following several chapters I provide a description of the verbal system of Bardi. There are many interdependent systems where a knowledge of one part of the system relies on a knowledge of morphology from other parts, so in this chapter I give an overview of the verb system, the categories for which verbs inﬂect, and an outline of other analyses of Bardi (Aklif 1999, Metcalfe 1975b, Nicolas 2000) along with the crucial points on which they differ from what is presented here. I present an analysis of simplex roots in Bardi. The purpose is to introduce the reader to the forms and the categories marked on the verb. It will allow the reader to ‘unpack’ the verb forms presented in the chapters on tense and agreement (Chapters 10 and 11), which will in turn provide background for the issues in analyzing complex predicates.
§12.2 provides materials for the analysis of inﬂecting verb roots. The actual verbal afﬁxal morphology of Bardi is discussed elsewhere. Chapter 10 contains information on the agreement marking system of afﬁxes and clitics, including the forms, their usage, and their distribution. In Chapter 11 I present tense, aspect and mood marking. Chapter 12 is a discussion of morphologically-derived valence-changing devices. In Chapter 13 I discuss complex predicate formation and light verb semantics.
Neither morphemic theories of morphology nor word-and-paradigm approaches (Anderson 1992) allow us to account for Bardi morphology satisfactorily. Bardi verb morphology is quasi-agglutinative; that is, much of the morphology is segmentable, with fairly transparent morphophonological processes; however, such processes are also rather irregular in their application. There are dependencies between morphemes, apparent phonological processes with no phonetic triggers, and processes such as lenition which are lexically determined. For example, most afﬁxes trigger lenition, but not all do. Bardi verb morphology also provides an interesting counterpoint to theories of prominence which place the root as the most prominent part of a word (e.g. de Lacy 2000, Zoll 2004); many deletion processes target the initial syllable of the root.

362 Verbal Predicate Structure
1. Overview of the system
Bardi verb morphology is arguably entirely inﬂectional. There is only one afﬁx—the ﬁrst applicative (discussed in §12.4.1)—which has any derivational properties.
1.1. Verbal morphemes
All verbal predicates comprise a verb which is inﬂected for preﬁxes, sufﬁxes and clitics. Complex predicates also have an uninﬂecting preverb that always precedes the inﬂecting root.
(9.1) (Preverb) Preﬁxes-ROOT-Sufﬁxes=Clitics
All inﬂecting verbs in Bardi show a person preﬁx, and are marked for tense; there are an additional ten optional preﬁx and sufﬁx slots which mark transitivity, tense, aspect, applicatives and reﬂexive/reciprocal derivation. An expanded template is given in Figure 9.1 below. I make no attempt to show cooccurrence restrictions in Figure 9.1, although I do include the Tr(ansitivity) morpheme n- ∼ a- twice (when the subject is minimal, it occurs before tense; when the subject is augmented, it occurs following the augment marker).124
A diagram of the maximal verb is given in Figure 9.2 below, along with the shape of the morphemes that can occupy each afﬁx slot. Because of the size of the diagram, preﬁxes, sufﬁxes and clitics are each given on separate lines. Note that not all categories are instantiated in every form; which morphemes appear is conditioned by the tense and transitivity of the verb, and the initial consonant of the root. Further discussion of these dependencies is given in §9.1.6 and, for clarity, preﬁx bundles are presented in paradigms in §9.2.125 There are also some dependencies in the clitic system; for example, the quantiﬁer =nid cannot co-occur with third person augmented direct object marking. I treat those co-occurrence restrictions as semantic rather than morphological, however.
Finally, it should be noted that the template in Figure 9.2 applies only to ﬁnite verbs. Bardi also has gerunds (see §11.3) which have highly reduced afﬁxal marking. They may still take the reﬂexive/reciprocal circumﬁx, the inner applicative, and clitics (direct objects and sentential clitics only are attested), but no tense or agreement marking.

1.2. Morphological discontinuities and dependencies

There are several points to note with respect to the template in Figure 9.2. Firstly, person and number preﬁxes are discontinuous. Tense marking intervenes between the person marker (in (9.2), a-) and the augment marker arr-:126

(9.2) a- ng- arr-

past

a- ngg- arr-

future

1- tense augment

Next, the second person (minimal) and third person (minimal and augmented) markers vary for tense; in the future and irrealis the third person marker is oo-, whereas in the present and past it is i-. The future and imperative (but not irrealis) of the second person is a- or nga-, it is mi- in the other tenses/moods. The second person future/imperative also shows variation for root valency. It is nga- on monovalent verbs and a- on bivalent verbs. (9.3) illustrates both preﬁxes with the root -jiidi- ‘go’, which forms a transitive stem -jiidi-ng- ‘touch’.

(9.3) a. ngayiida! ‘go!’ (monovalent root -jiidi- ‘go’) b. anjiidang! ‘touch it!’ (transitive stem -jiidi-ng- ‘touch’)

Another dependency involves the transitivity preﬁx. The placement of the transitivity marker (which has the form n- ∼ a-) is dependent on the number of the subject; it appears between the person and tense marking in the minimal forms, but after number marking in the augment. This is illustrated in (9.4).

1.3. Roots
The form of the root also varies according to the type of preﬁx. Obstruentinitial roots lose their initial consonant in some tenses, and lenite it to w (< b) or y (< j or g) in others. Sonorant-initial roots trigger epenthesis in many cases. These changes are morphologized artifacts of historical sound changes; for more detailed description see §9.2 and for the description of morphologized lenition, see §3.6.2. The j-initial roots have a further irregularity in that in the transitive the past tense morpheme does not appear, as illustrated in (9.5), which means either ‘he/she sees it’ or ‘he/she saw it’:127
(9.5) a. injalana: as though from i- n- jala -na with the -ø present tense marker
b. *inanyjalana: as though from i- n- ng- jala -na, expected by analogy with other transitive verbs.
Glide-vowel interaction produces other quirks; thus the verb -boo- ‘hit’ has third person minimal inamboona but augmented ingorrona, from an underlying i-ng-arr-a-boo-na, where *abu > o through sound change. This pattern has been extended to roots beginning with ba- and ga-, whereas it is proper etymologically only to those beginning with boo- and goo-). §3.6 provides full details.
1.4. Sufﬁxes
Sufﬁx forms are less complex phonologically, although the semantics are intricate and the morphophonemics are somewhat irregular. Further information about TAM marking is to be found in Chapter 11. A point to note is that unlike previous linguists who have worked on Bardi (e.g. Metcalfe 1975b), I recognize two slots for the applicative marker -ng(a), whereas previous authors use only one. Forms such as (9.6) show that a stem can be doubly inﬂected for applicatives:
(9.6) Ingirrmiidinginyjinggal
i- ng- [a]rr- m- [j]iidi -ng -inyi -ng -gal 3- PST- AUG -REFL1 go -APPL1 -REFL2 -APPL2 -REC.PST
‘They were touching each other with it [a feather] recently.’128

Overview of the system 367
There are dependencies between the tense/mood preﬁxes and the tense/ aspect sufﬁxes. Multiple tense/aspect sufﬁxes are possible, and they are interleaved between other sufﬁxal morphology on the verb.

1.5. Clitics

There are three types of clitics in Bardi. Sentential clitics, such as the linker =b(a), the relator =(j)amb, and contrastive and resumptive topic markers =min and =gid appear immediately following the verb stem. These clitics may take hosts other than verbs. They are second position clitics which appear on the ﬁrst word of the phrase; if that word is a verb, they appear at the end of the stem, before any VP or verbal clitics. This is illustrated in (9.7). Agreement clitics follow sentential clitics; the order is oblique object before direct object. Possessors may also be marked as a clitic to the verb. Finally, there is marking for quantiﬁcation in the verbal clitic complex which may refer to either grammatical subject or object (see §10.5 for discussion).

(9.7) Jiyaroong irrbarndin goron, injanboongorrorirr amboorinynim irronjamb ambooriny.

Jiyaroong i-rr-barndi-n gor-on,

stoneﬁsh 3AUG-bury-CONT sand-LOC

i-n-janboo-n=gorror=irr

ambooriny-nim

3-TR-step.on-CONT=IF=3A.DO people-ERG

i-rr-o-n=jamb

ambooriny.

3-AUG-poke-CONT=THUS people

‘Stoneﬁsh (Synanceia horrida) bury themselves in the sand. They poke people (with the spines) if people step on them.’

Direct and oblique129 objects are marked by sufﬁxal clitics which follow any sentential clitics. Moreover, these clitics have topic forms (usually beginning with jarr-). In previous analyses these forms have either been omitted from discussion or have been assumed to be conditioned allomorphically (if the stem ends in a consonant, it takes a jarr- form; otherwise it takes a ‘plain’ form). I show in §10.3.2, however, that this conditioning is incidental to the actual factors dictating the use of jarr- forms, whose use is governed by considerations of topic continuity.

368 Verbal Predicate Structure

Bardi has possessor raising;130 it is found in addition to the oblique marking. Previous analyses have treated possessor raising as a type of ‘oblique’ agreement. The analysis of possessor marking is complicated by the fact that although possessor morphemes are placed with the clitics, they show phonological behavior more typical of sufﬁxes.
No verb with all three of the oblique object, raised possessor and direct object has been attested, although in principle there seems no reason why such a combination could not occur. ‘My mother brought those ﬁsh for me’, *birrii inangganajananirr aarli would be an example, but is judged ungrammatical. Examples of two of three markers are fairly common in the corpus.
In Bardi there are also quantiﬁcational enclitics (such as =nidi) which refer to the number of the subject. (9.8) and (9.9) provide examples. Both verbs are monovalent, so =nid, although apparently in the direct object clitic position on the verb, cannot be marking a direct object.

(9.8) Angalandnid mayoon.

A-ng-aland=nid

may-oon.

1-PST-[AUG]-sit.down-QUANT food-SOURCE

‘We sat down to eat.’

(Aklif’s notes to DW:IWA/p. 117)

(9.9) Barnanggarragij irralgalnidi bigibigi ngoorrngoolondarr.

Barnanggarra=gij irralgal=nidi

bigibigi

3-AUG-be-REC.PST-QUANT pigs

ngoorrngool-ondarr.

mangrove-LOC2

‘Just now all the pigs were in the mangroves.’ (Metcalfe 1975b:4: ex 24)

Another clitic in this position, =(j)angarr ‘only’, can have scope over the verb itself. In this way its use is parallel to other uses on other word classes; see §10.5 for more examples.

1.6. Co-occurrence restrictions
1.6.1. Transitivity
There are some clear co-occurrence restrictions in the Bardi verb. The transitivity marker n- ∼ a- and the reﬂexive/reciprocal preﬁx may not co-occur,

Overview of the system 369

as in (9.10), where there is no transitivity marking in the preﬁx complex in verbs which have reﬂexive/reciprocal marking.

(9.10) anggarrmalinyja
a- ngga- rr- m- al -inyj -a 1- FUT- AUG- REFL see -REFL -FUT

‘We will see each other.’

In this example, if the verb were marked with a transitive preﬁx, we would expect to see a preﬁx a- following the augment marker rr-. Furthermore, reﬂexive/reciprocal verbs take the intransitive form of the second person minimal preﬁx, as illustrated in (9.11) below:

(9.11) Joo ngamalalinyja baybirrony bard arr ngandan.

Joo nga-m-alal-inyj-a

baybirrony bard arr

2MIN 2IMP-REFL-look.after-REFL-FUT behind off go

nga-n-d-an.

1-TRdo/say-CONT

‘Look after yourself after I have gone.’

1.6.2. Tense and mood

Secondly, certain tense preﬁxes and tense/aspect sufﬁxes have co-occurrence restrictions. The future sufﬁx -a may only occur with the future, imperative, or irrealis preﬁxes. It is unacceptable with the past preﬁx:

(9.12)

a. Anarla jiiba may!

A-n-arl-a

jiiba may!

IMP-TR-eat-FUT this food.

‘Eat this food!’

b. *Nga-na-rl-a. 1MIN-TR-[PST]-eat-FUT

(Intended: ‘I shall have eaten it.’)

That is, there is no future perfect marking in the language.

370 Verbal Predicate Structure

There are other tense/mood and aspect co-occurrence restrictions. The irrealis preﬁx l-, for example, blocks the appearance of -gal ‘recent past’ or -ij ‘middle perfect’; the only sufﬁxes that it can occur with are the future -a, the continuative -n and the remote/general past -na. Further information can be found in Chapter 11.
The future preﬁx ngg- may occur with the perfective sufﬁx -ij, although it is rare:

(9.13) Ngaanka inonggonboojirri ngayoonyarr jarr aamb oonkalij.
Ngaanka i-no-ng-gonboo=jirri ngayoo-nyarr jarr aamb message 3-TR-PAST-send=2M.DO 1MIN-COM this man oo-n-k-al-ij. 3-FUT-TR-see-PFV

‘The man sent a message with me that he will look for you.’ (Aklif ﬁeld notes)

The morpheme in this example is ambiguous, however, and can be read either as the middle perfect -ij or as second person oblique agreement.131 (9.14), however, is unlikely to be anything other than the imperative/future and -ij:

(9.14) Ngayiidingij! Nga-yiidi-ng-ij! 2 . I M P -go-A P P L2 - P F V
‘Go with it!’

(NI: BOW-FN.11/28)

Finally, T/A2 and T/A3 sufﬁxes cannot co-occur. That is, a verb cannot be simultaneously marked for remote (or general) past and a more speciﬁc tense/aspect sufﬁx. Remote past marking can, however, occur with the continuous aspect marker.

1.6.3. Agreement marking
Another potential co-occurrence restriction is the presence of both an oblique object and a direct object in some verbs. Although many verbs take both morphological markers, and there appear to be no restrictions on the use of

Overview of the system 371

oblique adjuncts, there seem to be no truly ditransitive verbs in Bardi. Verbs that we would expect on the basis of other languages to be candidates for ditransitives, such as ‘give’ and ‘show’, take only two arguments in Bardi: a subject (marked by a preﬁx) and a single clitic:

(9.15)

a. Injoolngoogaljarran I-n-joolngoo-gal=jarran 3-TR-tell-REC.PST=1MIN.IO.TOP
‘He/she told me [about them].’ b. * I-n-joolngoo-gal=jarran=irr
3-TR-tell-REC.PST=1MIN.IO.TOP=3A.DO (intended:) ‘He/she told me about them.’(NI: BOW-FN.11/29)

It does not seem to be possible to have all three of oblique and direct objects and possessives marked on a single verb in Bardi. For example, example (9.16a) was corrected to (9.16b) in the meaning ‘your children are frightened of my children:’

(9.16)

a. ?? Joo-nim jiya-rr

bo

2MIN-ERG 2M.POSS-3A woman’s.child

i-rr-jargi-n=jirr

ngajana-rr bo.

3-AUG-fear-CONT=3AUG.IO 1M.POSS-3A woman’s.child

‘Your children are frightened of my children.’

b. Joonim jiyarr bo irrjarginjinan bo.

Joo-nim jiya-rr

bo

2MIN-ERG 2M.POSS-3A woman’s.child

i-rr-jargi-n=jin=an

bo.

3-AUG-fear-CONT-3M.IO-1M.POSS woman’s.child

‘Your children are frightened of my children.’

Examples exist in the corpus of DO marking and possession, of possession and IO marking, and of DO and adjunct IO marking.

1.7. Templatic marking
As noted by Nordlinger (2010), many Northern Australian languages have systems of verbal morphology which are reminiscent of the ‘templatic’ systems of some North American families (see e.g. Rice 2000). Nordlinger

372 Verbal Predicate Structure
(2010:329ff) lists several properties as being particularly associated with templatic systems. One is ‘the lack of headed structure,’ that is, the interleaving of derivational and inﬂectional morphology, since in such cases, the outermost afﬁx added to the word does not determine its syntactic class. Bardi verb morphology does not have this property. The only clearly derivational afﬁx is the reﬂexive/reciprocal marker m- -inyji, which occurs adjacent to the verb root.132
The second is multiple exponence, that is, the marking of a single morphological category in more than one place in the word. This is found to a limited extent in Bardi, for example with subject person and subject number. It is also found in the tense/aspect/mood system, where tense can be marked in three places in the verb: in the subject person allomorph, as a preﬁx, and as several sufﬁxes. However, as Nordlinger (2010:329) and Stump (2001) note, many morphological systems have multiple exponence. It is not diagnostic of template morphology uniquely. Bardi does have some discontinuous dependencies, however, and these are associated with templatic systems.
Simpson and Withgott (1986) argue that null morphemes are more prevalent in templatic morphology than in other types of morphological systems. Bardi has a null present tense preﬁx, null sufﬁxal agreement in third person, a null (or unmarked) tense sufﬁx, and null intransitive marking. There are no true variable orderings of morphemes; they are all morphologically conditioned. For example, although transitivity and tense preﬁxes can occur in opposite orders, the conditioning factor is the presence or absence of the subject augmented number morpheme; the morpheme orders are not in true variation. The ﬁnal feature of templatic marking is the lack of functional unity in afﬁx positions. Bardi does not show this; there are not the co-occurrence restrictions that characterize templatic morphology such as those found in Murrinh-Patha. Thus overall, Bardi morphology does not appear to have the characteristics of templatic morphology, with the exception of null morphs and discontinuous multiple exponence.
2. Verb paradigms
To make the previous section clearer, this section presents partial paradigms of fully inﬂected Bardi verbs. The fully inﬂected verbs allow a better illustration of the interaction between the initial consonants of the root and the preﬁx bundle. While the template presented in Figure 9.2 holds as a whole, and can

Verb paradigms 373
be used to generate fully inﬂected verbs, there are numerous points where there are co-dependencies. Moreover, the lenition processes which affect the initial consonant of the root make it quite difﬁcult to parse some roots.
Root behavior falls into three main classes; obstruent-initial roots (roots can begin with b, j, and g), vowel-initial roots (the vast majority of roots begin with a, i, or ii), and sonorant-initial roots (m, ny, ng, r, rl, or l). Tables 9.1 and 9.2 summarize the shapes of preﬁx complexes, using the verb roots -jarrala- ‘run’, -jala- ‘see’, -gama- ‘laugh/mock’, and -marra- ‘cook/burn’ as illustrations. Sufﬁxes are much more straightforward, so are not illustrated separately here. The only important point of preﬁx morphology which is not captured by these tables is the exceptionality of second person future forms, which are listed in §10.2 and are spelled out in full in Aklif (1999).
2.1. Obstruent-initial roots
Roots which have an obstruent as their initial consonant undergo lenition. The outcome of the lenition is dependent on the syllable of the word in which the form occurs. In the present minimal forms, the root is the second syllable in the word; only the monosyllable person preﬁx can occur before it. In this position, the lenition outcome is a glide: y if the root begins with j- or g-, and w- if it begins with b. There are no roots in the lexicon which begin with d. The other Nyulnyulan languages have a few such roots, but they do not have Bardi cognates. The root for ‘do/say’ shows a d in some forms, but it is irregular. See further §9.7. In the augment forms, the lenition outcome is zero; that is, the initial consonant of the root (and the initial vowel of the root) is deleted.
Roots beginning with b or g show an additional alternation. In the augmented forms of the present and past transitive, and in the future and irrealis (all numbers), the ﬁrst CV of the stem is replaced with o. These are the positions where historically the sequence *agu and *abu would have been monophthongized to o; it appears that the alternation has been extended from roots which began only with ku- or bu- to most of the roots which begin with g and b. Support for the origin of the alternation in sound change comes from the cells of the paradigm in which the alternation occurs; they are the ones in which the initial stop of the root would have been preceded by a vowel. The change can be reconstructed from monomorphemic lexical items to have happened only between vowels.

Verb paradigms 375

376 Verbal Predicate Structure
Some verbs show exceptions, however; for example, the transitive root -barra- ‘dream of something’ has third person augment i-ng-arr-a-warra-na, with lenition of the form that we would otherwise expect only in intransitive minimal forms. (The expected form here is *ingorrorrana.) Exceptions such as these are listed in the dictionary.
2.2. Vowel-initial and sonorant-initial roots
Vowel- and sonorant-initial roots behave similarly in preﬁxation. Like the jinitial roots, they show no difference in transitive forms between present and past. There are no intransitive vowel-initial roots attested in the corpus, and vowel-initial roots are rare. Vowel initial roots are irregular in their gerund forms, in that they have an epenthetic n; thus the gerund of -ibi- ‘drink’ is manibin, not *mibin or *mabin. The example paradigm in Table 9.2 shows vowel harmony in the vowel of the augment.
3. Previous analyses of Bardi verb morphology
The template in (9.2) is my analysis of the forms and placement of morphemes in the Bardi verb. Others have drawn somewhat different conclusions as to the composition of Bardi verb roots (as well as the templates needed for other Nyulnyulan languages). In this section I summarize the main published analyses of Bardi (Aklif 1999, Metcalfe 1975b, Nicolas 1998) and describe how they differ from that presented here.
3.1. Metcalfe (1975b)
Metcalfe (1975b) is the published version of Metcalfe (1974), a dissertation on Bardi verb morphology (and the ﬁrst formal analysis of the morphology of any Nyulnyulan language). It is cast within a transformational framework; the aim of Metcalfe’s thesis was to show that languages like Bardi, with complex quasi-agglutinative morphology, can be treated within a generative framework, and to bring into focus some of the difﬁculties that arise in such an analysis where the languages exhibit complex agreement strategies. Metcalfe (1975b) is an early version of the pronominal argument hypothesis (usually attributed to Jelinek 1984), in treating Bardi verbs as ‘clauses in miniature’

Previous analyses of Bardi verb morphology 377

and analyzing the bound ‘agreement’ markers as the actual subcategorized arguments, as implied by notations such as the following:133

(9.17)

[NP,S] VP

[NP,PredP]

iNara- ma-nana- r

they- put-used to -them

‘They used to put them (in the tree-cofﬁn).’

(Metcalfe 1975b:15)

Metcalfe’s phrase structure trees also imply that he analyzes the bound ‘agreement’ markers as arguments. In Figure 9.3 (a tree of the sentence ‘They are cutting the ﬁsh with a knife.’), Metcalfe treats the pronominal argument as a nominal element. That is, the verb agreement marker is taken to be a terminal node within an NP, and is realized as a pronominal afﬁx on the verb through a transformation.134
Metcalfe’s analysis characterizes Bardi as having a series of slots within the verb. That is, his is not a strictly derivational analysis, but one more in the spirit of ‘templatic morphology’. Metcalfe (1975b) analyzes Bardi as having four preverbal slots and twenty-one further bound morpheme slots on the inﬂecting verb, in addition to the inﬂecting root itself. His slots are given in Figure 9.4, repeated from Metcalfe (1975b:4). Since Metcalfe’s analysis is very different from other descriptions of Bardi verb morphology, and is the only other detailed published treatment of the language basides this one, I have provided a key to the ﬁgure below, including the label Metcalfe gives, the form and corresponding label used here, and a reference to the section where it is discussed. Where no single form is given in Table 9.3, there is a paradigm associated with the slot, the forms of which are given elsewhere.
There are seven areas where Metcalfe’s analysis differs from later ones. First, he appears to make no distinction between afﬁxes and clitics. Such a distinction is useful in the description of Bardi verbs, since it allows us to explain why some ‘verbal’ markers (such as agreement markers) appear to be able to be hosted by items other than verbs. Aklif (1999) also makes no overt distinction. Metcalfe’s slots make no indication of co-occurrence restrictions (although he does discuss these extensively in the text of the book). It is not clear, however, why tense and mood (slots 7 ‘potential’ and 8 ‘tense’) could not be combined.
Furthermore, this description of the verb does not distinguish between elements which occur only on verbs (or in the VP) and those that may also occur on other items. Of the authors who discuss the question, Metcalfe is the

only linguist to have worked on Bardi morphology to treat clausal clitics as part of the VP. In some cases, clausal clitics require special description in the verb, because they interact with other verbal clitics. In other cases, however, the sentential marker appears as expected. One example is the polar question particle nganyji, which tends to occur clause initially, although it is moveable. Thus Metcalfe’s description of the particle as preverbal is only correct when the verb is second in the clause, and there are frequent examples where other orders appear. (9.18) shows Metcalfe’s ordering, while (9.19) shows other permissible orders.

(9.19a) is grammatical but somewhat forced due to the fact that polar questions with a constituent in focus are usually marked by =(b)ard(a) rather than nganyji (for which see §15.4.1). Other acceptable orders of (9.19a) are Nganyji bardi minjooloongirr gooyarra aarli? and Bardi nganyji minjooloongirr gooyarra aarli?. There is a strong preference for verb second (following nganyji) in these clauses, which probably follows from the function of nganyji as a clausal polar interrogative (rather than a constituent interrogative). In such cases the action of the clause is the (new) focused information. Alternative orders would create a pragmatic mismatch between the sense of nganyji and the focal effects of non-verbal constituents in initial position.
The relative ordering of the question particle and negation in Metcalfe’s template is incorrect; they should be reversed. Arra cannot precede nganyji. Sequences of the form arra nganyji do appear, but in all cases arra here is the interjection ‘hey!’, not the negation marker. They can be distinguished by intonation, by meaning, and by the fact that negation triggers irrealis morphology on the verb, whereas the interjection does not. The inclusion of a separate ‘negative emphasis’ category is also odd. The ‘negative emphasis’ category is the word arranga ‘without’. Historically a case-marked quantiﬁer in the instrumental which is now used as a preposition:135

(9.20) arranga aarli without meat/ﬁsh ‘without meat/ﬁsh’

Metcalfe’s treatment of the initial consonant of the inﬂecting root as a separate morpheme is somewhat counterintuitive. True, the initial consonant of the root is one of the determinants of the form of the preﬁx chunk, and it does

382 Verbal Predicate Structure
interact with the preﬁx bundles and it sometimes disappears. We should not be led by this, however, to treat the initial consonant as a distinct morpheme. The behavior of Bardi verb roots can be captured by morphophonemic processes. Metcalfe also treats the ﬁnal vowel of the verb root as ‘transitional’ (Metcalfe 1975b:55) and says that almost all verb stems end in a consonant. I treat most (if not all) roots as ending in a vowel, which is deleted when a vowel initial sufﬁx follows, and which can harmonize. Since not all ﬁnal vowels are predictable, an analysis which retains them in the underlying form is preferable.
Metcalfe takes reduplication as preﬁxal; I assume it is synchronically inﬁxal/sufﬁxal but historically targeted the whole root. I also treat it as a derivational process rather than inﬂectional, and do not include it in descriptions of afﬁxal material (such as Table 9.2).
3.2. Aklif (1993a, 1999)
Aklif’s thesis analysis (Aklif 1993a) is similar to that adopted here. The main differences are terminological, or in a few cases reﬂect more complete information than that which was available to Aklif. The other difference is the treatment of plural transitive paradigms. While Aklif treats forms such as angarra- ‘ﬁrst person augment past transitive’ as involving a deleted ntransitivity marker historically, I treat that analysis as a potential synchronic analysis only, a convenient trigger for cluster reduction (see Bowern 2001). This is not historically accurate, since we have comparative evidence that the transitivity marker was n- in minimal forms but a- in augmented ones. Thus for Aklif the underlying form is a-ng-arr-n-, whereas here I treat it as a-ng-arr-a-. This is also what I would reconstruct to Proto-Nyulnyulan, mutatis mutandis.
Aklif’s template of the Bardi verb is given in (9.21). There are 17 slots in the verb. The ﬁrst 8 are preﬁxal, slot 9 is the root, and the remaining 8 are sufﬁxal. The ‘slots’ in this analysis are morphemic, but also include items like the epenthetic vowel which appears before sonorant-initial verb roots in some forms. The template also contains two slots for transitivity marking, reﬂecting the difference between minimal and augmented roots. The ‘associative’ sufﬁx is my applicative2.
In Aklif (1999) the analysis presented is a little different. Aklif presents the preﬁx chunks as unanalyzable wholes, without further morpheme bound-

Previous analyses of Bardi verb morphology 383

aries. This is designed to make the morphology seem less frightening to a learner approaching the language for the ﬁrst time. Those paradigms have formed the basis for the presentation in Tables 9.1 and 9.2.

The other two differences between Aklif’s analysis and that presented here are that possessor raising is treated by Aklif as oblique agreement, and some sufﬁxes are not discussed, although the presence of slot 14, ‘other sufﬁxes,’ implies that Aklif recognized other morphemes within the verb.

3.3. Nicolas (1998, 2000)

Nicolas’ analysis is very similar to the others, although less detailed and less
accurate. The template she gives in Nicolas (2000:158) is repeated below, in (9.22):136

There are multiple inaccuracies in this diagram. Her tense and aspect morphemes are reversed, as forms such as i-n-a-marra-n-gal ‘(s)he was cooking

384 Verbal Predicate Structure
it’ show. In that form, -n is the continuous aspect marker and -gal is a tense marker. She misses the dual placement of the transitivity morpheme. I also disagree with the characterization of certain morphemes as purely ‘temporal’ and others as only ‘aspectual’; see further Chapter 11 on the relationship between tense, aspect, Aktionsart, and mood in Bardi.
Nicolas’ persObj (personal object) and Benef(active) morphemes are not mutually exclusive, and the ‘benefactive’ (my ‘Oblique’) precedes the direct object, rather than following it, as Nicolas states.137 Nicolas simply does not have enough places in her template to describe the morphology of Bardi verbs accurately. Finally, Nicolas does not formally distinguish sufﬁxes from clitics in her analysis.
Nicolas is not explicit about the role she assumes for agreement preﬁxes, that is whether they are agreement preﬁxes or pronominal arguments.

4. Dialectal differences in verb morphology

From the small amount of Jawi data recorded it appears that verb inﬂection in Jawi is identical to Bardi, with one exception. Both the Coate tapes materials for Jawi and the Laves texts show third person augmented nyarr- and third person minimal nyin-. The forms do not vary for transitivity. This is illustrated in (9.23), where the same form is found on both intransitive and transitive verbs. All forms in the text are past tense, so it is not known whether there are other dialect-speciﬁc forms in other tenses, or whether the preﬁxes nyinand nyarr- are marked for tense at all.

(9.23)

Jawi a. nyarrunujin = Bardi ingirrinijin ‘they spoke to him’ b. nyarramarrana = Bardi ingarramarrana ‘they cooked it’ c. nyarrjiidina = Bardi ingirrjiidina ‘they went’

Several forms in (9.23) require comment. (9.23a) shows that verbs with this preﬁx show initial root consonant deletion, as with regular preﬁx chains. However, the stem of the verb is different in this case; the verb -joo- ‘do, say’ has three stems—-joo-, -ji-, and -di-, which are used in different tenses. Even though the Bardi form (and the Jawi form in this tense with the regular preﬁxes) takes the root form -ji- in this tense, when the irregular preﬁx appears, the root form is -joo-. From (9.23b), it seems that rules of vowel

Dialectal differences in verb morphology 385

epenthesis between preﬁx chain and root apply, as in the regularly inﬂected preﬁxed forms. (An alternative analysis is that the form nyarr- replaces all preﬁxes up to the transitive marker in the augmented forms.)
These preﬁx forms are not always used; they clearly alternate with preﬁx chains which reﬂect the template given in Table 9.1 above. Example (9.24) gives an example of the use of nyarr-, with the Bardi forms (where different) provided underneath for comparison. Glossing is schematic only, since the Bardi and Jawi morphemes do not line up exactly.

‘Marligoo chased the layoord spirit; they chased each other around a rock; he threw a little rock and he ran away from the rock.’
(Laves 128/7)

The etymology of the third person preﬁx nyarr- is unknown. It has no direct parallels in other Nyulnyulan languages. The closest item is in Warrwa, where the third person subject marker i- is dropped in most afﬁx combinations; thus the third person augmented preﬁx bundle in Warrwa is ngarr-, rather than ingarr- (McGregor 1994b).
Another minor difference between Jawi and Bardi verb forms is the intervocalic loss of ng in Jawi, producing, for example, inoorrinybin for Bardi inoongoorribin138 ‘he chased him’. The conditioning of this sound change

386 Verbal Predicate Structure
is impossible to state from the available data. It occurs, for example, in the allative; compare Jawi biilan ‘[he’s going] for ﬁghting’ with Bardi biilingan. It is optional, however. Examples with ng unelided in Jawi could be register or dialect shift.
No other differences are recorded between Jawi and Bardi verb morphology. There are also no recorded differences in verb morphology in the other Bardi dialects, beyond what is expected from sound change (for example, both Baard verb roots and inﬂected forms tend not to end in ﬁnal vowels, as expected in a dialect where ﬁnal vowels are lost).

5. Reduplication of verb roots and preverbs
Reduplication is found in several word classes in Bardi. The morpho-phonological aspects of reduplication were discussed in §3.8; here I describe the semantics of reduplicated verb roots, along with coverbs, since the same semantic principles apply.
The function of reduplication in Australian languages was the subject of Fabricius (1998); she determined that the primary functions of verbal reduplication in these languages are iterative and distributive. That is, reduplicating a verb marks the action of the verb as iterative (done over and over again), or it implies that the action is done multiple times by different people. Bardi conforms to this pattern, although as Metcalfe (1975b:30) points out, reduplicating the verb root can produce different semantic results with different verbs. Reduplication is, however, primarily iterative, distributive, or pluractional. No one working on Bardi has done a detailed semantic study of this topic, to my knowledge.

5.1. Iteration and distribution

Example (9.25) illustrates the iterative use of reduplication. The unreduplicated root -gardi- means ‘enter’, while -gardardi- means ‘to enter over and over again, to keep on going in and out.’ This root is used of ﬁsh swimming in and out of a rock hole, for example.

(9.25) ingarrardardanana (root: -gardi- ‘enter’)

i-ng-arr-ard-arda-na-na 3-PST-AUG-go.in-REDUP-CONT-REM.PST

‘They kept going in and out.’

(Metcalfe 1975b:33)

Reduplication of verb roots and preverbs 387

Example (9.25) could also be described as distributed, since the action of entering is being performed multiple times by multiple actors. In other cases, however, the action is performed multiple times by a single actor:

(9.26) Mayi gorrgorr injooloongan Joongoonoongoorr injooloongan inarlinamb.

3-TR-collect-APPL1-CONT 3-TR-eat-CONT=THUS.

‘Joongoonoongoorr ﬁnished gathering food and then ate it.’ (L83.012)

As might be expected, reduplicated roots tend to co-occur with the continuous aspect marker; see further §11.2.2.

ari-yoon goowidi agal ari-yoon goowid garda.

one-SOURCE month and one-SOURCE month still

‘They cut up that miinimbi (whale) month after month.’ (HHW.031)

5.2. Intensivity
Reduplication in roots occasionally results in giving an intensive meaning to the root, such as in (9.28). Speakers translating such sentences usually add ‘vigorously’, ‘very much’, and the like.
(9.28) inggalgalgamanana (root: -galgama- ‘move around’) I- ng- galg- algama -na -na 3 PST- REDUP- move.about -CONT -REM.PST
‘It kept moving about vigorously.’ (Metcalfe 1975b:30 (ex. 18))

388 Verbal Predicate Structure

5.3. Pluractionality

Pluractionality is another function of reduplication, illustrated in (9.29). Metcalfe (1975b) describes this use of reduplication as specifying further information about the subject of the clause; however it can also be seen as illustrating pluractionality, where multiple subjects engage in the same action, rather than the same group of people doing the action multiple times (see Wood 2008).

(9.29) Daagadaag ingirrini. Daaga-daag i-ng-irr-i-ni. REDUP-sleep 3-PST-AUG-do/say-PST
‘They ALL slept.’ (Metcalfe’s gloss) (Metcalfe 1975b:32: ex 21)

Another function of reduplication described by Metcalfe is where the reduplication speciﬁes further information about the object. Again, however, this is probably a case of pluractionality. Note that such examples all seem to appear with plural subjects, which we might expect if we are to distinguish pluractionality from iteration.139

(9.30) Ingoorroolooloorroonoo noorroo.
I-ng-oorr-oo-loo-loorroo-noo no˙orroo. 3PST-(TR)-REDUP-light-DIST.PST ﬁre

‘They lit a LARGE ﬁre.’

(Metcalfe 1975b:32: ex 22)

In Nyikina (Stokes 1982a:231) reduplication is also apparently used with inchoative meanings, as in (9.31) below, although this function has not been recorded for Bardi, and the equivalent form would mean ‘I’ll keep on burning the meat’.

(9.31) Nyikina Ngan-a-marra-marra warli-ø. 1M-FUT-REDUP-cook/burn meat-ABS
‘I’m going to start cooking the meat.’

(Stokes 1982a:231)

Light verbs 389
6. Light verbs
Verb roots in Nyulnyulan languages can also be classiﬁed according to their ability to function as light verbs in complex predicate constructions. The verbs in question are known as ‘light verbs’ because in some contexts they do not have the usual full meaning of the normal verb.140 The verb is bleached of most of its meaning and contributes a more abstract notion to the clause. In Bardi light verbs are used in preverb + inﬂecting verb constructions (analyzed in detail in Chapter 13). The inﬂecting verb hosts agreement and tense/aspect morphology. The examples in (9.32) below show two light verbs in use. In (9.32a), the preverb garr combines with the light verb -boo- to form a complex predicate meaning ‘rub’. Example (9.32b) shows another example, this time intransitive. The preverb roowil combines with the inﬂecting verb -inya- to form a predicate meaning ‘walk’. Note that although glosses have been given for roowil and garr, neither item exists independently of the complex predicate construction.
(9.32) a. garr nganamboogal ‘I rubbed him.’
Preverb: garr ‘rub’
Inﬂecting verb: -boo- ‘hit’
Entire predicate: ‘to rub (something) to stop the pain’.
b. roowil innyagal ‘He was walking.’
Preverb: roowil ‘walk’
Inﬂecting verb: -nya- ‘pick up, catch’
Entire predicate: ‘to walk’
A list of Bardi light verbs is given in Table 9.4 and Table 9.5 below. First appear the light verbs which commonly appear with preverbs; following appear the inﬂecting verbs which only occur in collocation with a few preverbs.
Light verbs themselves are either monovalent or bivalent; none of the common light verbs are ambitransitive. Note that this statement does not apply to the complex predicate as a whole, as complex predicates can exhibit transitivity mismatches. These are discussed in §13.8 below (see also Bowern 2008b).

7. Irregular roots
On the whole there are few truly ‘irregular’ verbs in Bardi; that is, verbs with suppletive morphology. More often, irregularity in the paradigm arises when aspectual combinations have unpredictable meaning, or when one tense serves for another. The root -gal- ‘visit, come and see’, for example, can be used in the present with future meaning, and the root -ni- often combines present preﬁxes with past tense sufﬁxes in past meaning. Compare irrinkal, ‘they were there’, not *ingirrinkal. A past tense of this verb does exist with preﬁx forms, but the root is deleted. A few verbs do not trigger vowel harmony; for example, the past tense of -boo- ‘hit’ is inamboona, not the expected *inoomboona. Some of these irregularities could be the result of dialect borrowing between Bardi and Jawi. Jawi is known to have had a more

The only irregular root that can be reconstructed to Proto-Nyulnyulan is *-ju- ∼ -di- ‘do/say’. The root has present and future tense forms in d and past forms in j (compare Bardi indan ‘he says’ but injoona ‘he said’).
A few monosyllabic roots have an extra syllable in some tense forms. The present of -ga- ‘carry’, for example is inkajan, not the expected *inkan. This is not found in other Nyulnyulan languages and the source in Bardi is unknown. The future form of this root is oonkaya, which is also irregular; the y-insertion is not found with other roots. The verb root -boo- ‘poke’ is found with the present form minboojan in the present (BE, 57.1; DW). There is a further irregularity in that one verb, -(a)rli- ‘eat’, has a mixed monovalent and bivalent paradigm.141

I have not found any defective paradigms in my data set. There are, however, a few verbs that have different meanings in the singular and plural. For example, the complex predicate gir -gal- means ‘live’ when the subject is plural, but ‘sleep with someone’ when the subject is singular.
Some roots are lexically speciﬁed for the gender of one of their participants. For example, -jarrarr- ‘stand up, get up’ always has men as its subject, and in the Laves texts, -jinmarra- ‘spear’ is usually used for spearing a woman.

Chapter 10 Agreement Morphology
In this chapter I describe the agreement categories marked in Bardi, speciﬁcally on Bardi simple predicates. Agreement in Bardi is for person and number. There are four agreement positions on Bardi verbs: subject, direct object, oblique, and possessor. Inﬂecting verbs agree for the subject of the verb, whether intransitive or transitive. Transitive verbs also agree for the direct object. ‘Oblique’ agreement, the third type, covers a variety of functions and ranges from oblique/indirect objects to recipients. Possessors may also be marked on the verb. Subject agreement is preﬁxal and is bound with tense marking, while oblique, possessive, and direct object agreement is cliticized to the end of the verb stem. A curious (and possibly unique) feature of Bardi object agreement is its marking of personal objects and obliques for their status as ‘topic.’
In addition to the ‘agreement’ marking, there are other clitics—hosted by the verb—which provide information of various types about arguments in the clause. For example, there are quantiﬁcational sufﬁxes which may refer to the number of the subject or object, depending on context; these occur in addition to the regular agreement markers.
Such marking raises questions about the argument status of the verbal markers. Work on languages from other families, including Mohawk (Baker 2000), Warlpiri (Austin and Bresnan 1996, Jelinek 1984), and Bininj Gunwok (Evans 1999), has provided discussion on whether the argument positions of complex verbs are likely to be manifestations of argument positions. Bardi can make a contribution here, since agreement is extensive; agreement is found for items which would not be considered arguments, and there are agreement feature mismatches. We can also consider the term ‘agreement’ to cover several different types of relations, from feature matching to anaphoric agreement and coreferentiality. These issues are explored in this chapter.
1. Domains of agreement
Agreement in the predicate is only one of several of domains of agreement or co-reference within Bardi, though it is the most extensive. Verbal predicates

394 Agreement Morphology

show the most extensive agreement, though nominal, adjectival, and adverbial predicates can also act as hosts for agreement clitic marking, as shown in (10.1). Such predicates are discussed in §15.2, though much of the description of verbal marking given in this chapter also applies to types of non-verb predicates.

(10.1)

a. Verb as host: Inamboonangay. I-na-m-boo-na=ngay. 3-TR-PST-hit-REM.PST=1M.DO

‘He/she/it hit me.’

b. Adjective as host: Joo ngaadajirri. Joo ngaada=jirri. 2MIN tall=2MIN.IO

‘You’re tall.’

c. Noun as host: “Arra nyimoonggoonjarrngay jalnggagoorroo

ngayoo,” injoonin aambanim.

“Arra nyi-moonggoon=jarrngay jalnggagoorroo ngayoo,”

NEG 2M-know=TOP.1MIN doctor.man 1MIN

i-n-joo-n=in

aamba-nim.

3-TR-say-CONT=3M.IO man-ERG

‘“You don’t know me, I’m a doctorman,” said the man.’ (A1839a The ‘Magic’ Drunkard.033)

As mentioned above, agreement in Bardi is for person (1, 2, 3, and 1+2), and number (minimal vs. augment; see §5.1.1 above). These categories are combined in portmanteau forms that inﬂect for both categories; note, however, that the augmented forms all contain a trill. Agreement patterns and person/number interaction are discussed above in Chapter 7.

2. Subject agreement
2.1. Subject preﬁxes
Preﬁxes most often display agreement for the subject of the clause. There are no null forms in subject agreement marking; every person and number has an exponent. Even though case marking is ergative/absolutive, agreement follows the more familiar pattern of ‘subject’ versus ‘object.’ This is illustrated

Subject agreement 395

in (10.2) below, where the same preﬁx form nga- is used for intransitive and transitive ﬁrst person minimal subjects.

(10.2)

a. Ngayoo ngalirrmin. Ngayoo nga-lirrmi-n 1MIN 1-call.out-CONT
‘I’m calling out.’ b. Ngayoonim nganamboonirr.
Ngayoo-nim nga-na-m-boo-n=irr 1MIN-ERG 1-TR-PST-spear-REM.PST=3A.DO
‘I was spearing them.’

(Intransitive) (Transitive)

We see here that the case split does not mirror the usual agreement split. Case marking is ergative/absolutive (and marks transitive and intransitive subjects differently), agreement is for the subject of the clause (and treats transitive and intransitive subjects the same). Bardi shows morphological ergativity in case marking, but no syntactic ergativity. Other tests, such as pivot tests, conﬁrm that Bardi is not syntactically ergative; see further Bowern (2008e) and §5.3.1 for further discussion of the ergative case and its functions.
Preﬁxal agreement is also found for the subject of imperatives; this is illustrated in (10.3). In this instance, the forms of the preﬁxes differ, as they are also marked for transitivity (see §11.1.3 below).

(10.3)

a. Anjala! A-n-jal-a! 2-TR-look.at-FUT
‘Look at it!’ b. Ngayarrala!
Nga-yarral-a! 2-run-FUT
‘Run!’

Examples (10.2) and (10.3) illustrate the regular pattern of agreement, which is found in the vast majority of clauses. There are, however, a few minor agreement patterns found in specialized constructions. In (10.4), for example, the ergative case-marked nominal is not cross-referenced by the subject; instead, the subject marker cross-references the ﬁrst person singular

396 Agreement Morphology

patient, and the verb is intransitive, as seen by the lack of transitivity preﬁxal marking.

(10.4) Aalganim ngangamarrana.
Aalga-nim nga-nga-marra-na sun-ERG 1-PST-cook-REM.PST

‘I got sun-burnt.’

The syntax of these constructions is further discussed in §5.3.1.2.3 and has been extensively discussed in Yawuru by Hosokawa (1991, 1996).
Just as in the free pronouns described in Chapter 7, the subject agreement forms are organized according a system of ‘minimal’ and ‘augment’ numbers. The forms of the Bardi subject agreement preﬁxes are given in Table 10.1 below.

Table 10.1. Subject agreement preﬁxes

3AUG

Augment

As noted above in §9.2, in the augmented forms, the tense/mood preﬁx intervenes between the person marking and the augment marker. Illustration of some forms is provided in (10.5), using the third person augmented i/oo-[a]rr. The tense/mood marker is underlined. The person and augment markers are in bold.

Subject agreement 397

present past future irrealis

‘they are cooking’ ‘they were cooking’ ‘they will be cooking’ ‘they might be cooking’

Second minimal and third person subject agreement preﬁxes vary for tense and mood. In the future and irrealis, the third person marker is oo-, whereas in the present and past it is i-. The future and imperative (but not irrealis) of the second person is a- or nga-, whereas we ﬁnd mi- in the other tenses/moods. The second person future/imperative also shows variation for root valency— it is nga- on monovalent verbs and a- on bivalent verbs. The second person augment future and imperative is arr-, built on the second person minimal (a-) with the augment marker.
Since copious examples of verbal subject agreement appear throughout the grammar, additional speciﬁc examples are not given here (see, for example, (10.2) and (10.3)). It is worth noting, however, that subject agreement can be anaphoric, as in (10.6), where the noun gayarjin ‘white people’ is cross-referenced with second person augmented agreement marking goo-rr-.

(10.6) Gayarjin arar aarlimay goorrarlin.

arar aarlimay goo-rr-a-rli-n.

white.people-GROUP different food 2-AUG-TR-eat-CONT

‘You white people eat all different types of food.’ (Conversation)

Such agreement is also found in ‘inclusive’ constructions, where agreement is augmented, and one or more members of the group referred to are referenced explicitly. In (10.7), for example, the verb has augmented agreement, and the ergative-marked numeral irrjaranim ‘three-ERG’ gives us the number of people referred to by the subject agreement marking; however, only two of them are named, implying that they are included in the set of participants, but do not constitute the whole set.

398 Agreement Morphology

2.2. Subject sufﬁxing

Subject agreement can also co-occur with quantiﬁcational cliticization to the verb. (10.8) is an example with the clitic =nid(i). It shows one of a number of items that mark ‘agreement’ (or which cross-reference features of a free nominal on the verb). When the verb is transitive, the clitic is interpreted with respect to the number of the object, but the clitic is also compatible with intransitive verbs, where the number marking is interpreted as referring to the number of subject.

Barnanggarra=gij i-rr-al-gal=nidi

ngoorrngool-ondarr.

mangrove-LOC.ALL

‘Just now all the pigs were in the mangroves.’ (Metcalfe 1975b:4: ex 24)

I assume that the preﬁx provides the agreement features for person and number and the clitic is anaphoric, and provides more information about the features of its referent, but is not a true agreement marker. The clitic is never obligatory, and its reference is interpretable with respect to different arguments on the verb depending on the transitivity of the predicate. Further examples of quantiﬁcational agreement (for subject and object) are described in §10.5 below.
The quantiﬁcational sufﬁxal marking in Bardi is reminiscent of the obligatory number marking that occurs on verbs in Eastern Nyulnyulan languages. In order to mark dual subjects, for example, a dual sufﬁx obligatorily appears with the augmented number in preﬁx marking. This is shown with an example from Yawuru, but Nyikina has a parallel construction.

‘They two argued together.’

(McGregor 2000:89)

The forms are =wili in Warrwa, -bili in Yawuru and -mirri in Nyikina.

Direct object agreement 399
3. Direct object agreement
Unlike the subject preﬁxes, the remainder of the verbal agreement types are enclitics, appearing at the end of the verbal word. The following sections describe object and oblique marking. Forms are given in Table 10.2 below.

3.1. Distribution of agreement marking

Bardi direct object markers are enclitic; they do not show the lenition patterns characteristic of sufﬁxes. Sentential clitics also intervene between the verb stem and the direct object markers (see (10.10)), providing further evidence for their status as clitics rather than afﬁxes. In (10.10), the third person augment object marker is =irr, and it is preceded by =gid, which connects clauses.

‘Mangrove oysters are on the roots of mangrove trees—we break them and we cook them on the ﬁre, still on the roots.’

These agreement clitics mark the direct object of transitive verbs. Most often the direct object is a patient, but other roles are also possible. Some examples of different semantic roles are given in (10.11) below. (10.11a) shows a patient/undergoer, (10.11b) shows the direct object form as a recipient, (10.11c) as an object of swearing, and (10.11c) as a theme.

d. Arra boojoolgoon milingjarrngay. Arra boojool-goon mi-l-i-ng=jarrngay. NEG stare-LOC 2-IRR-do-APPL=1M.DO

‘Don’t stare at me.’

Bardi is unusual among Nyulnyulan languages in allowing multiple agreement clitics. In both Nyulnyul and Nyikina, for example, DO and IO agreement is not obligatory and only one of the markers can appear at any one time. While Bardi allows multiple clitics as long as only one of them is an argument, there are cases where direct objects are not coreferenced on the verb. The issue of obligatory agreement is taken up in some detail in Bowern (2008a) and will be addressed only brieﬂy here. In Bowern (2008a) I argued that object agreement is correlated with deﬁniteness. That is, if an object noun phrase is semantically plural but indeﬁnite, it will be treated as singular, and hence receive the 3MIN agreement clitic, which is null. Collective objects (that is, objects which are plural but where the members of the group are not individuated) also receive singular agreement.

Nga-n-arli-na=ø

niimana aarli.

1-TR-eat-REM.PST[=3MIN] many ﬁsh

‘I ate many ﬁsh.’

Finally, some (intransitive) sentences appear to contain an ‘extra’ DO agreement sufﬁx; examples are given in (10.13) and (10.14) below. Example (10.13) is taken from a narrative in which the speaker has been presumed dead by his companions, and has just returned to camp covered in white ash and looking like a ngaarri spirit. The regular agreement pattern of the verb -jargi‘fear’ is an ergative subject (the fearers) and an IO-marked object of fear. In this case, the ‘additional’ ﬁrst person clitic =jarrngay is clearly emphatic.142 The form nganga is also used for emphasis to imply that ‘it’s me and no one else.’ See the following section for the form of the object markers in such examples.

(10.13) “Arra goolarrjargajanjarrngay nganga,” injoonoojirr.
“Arra goo-l-arr-jarga=jan=jarrngay nga-nga,” NEG 2A-IRR-AUG-fear=1M.IO=1M.DO 1-name i-n-joo-noo=jirr. 1-TR-do-REM.PST=3A.IO

‘“Don’t be frightened of me!” he told them.’ (10.14) Inkoorrnim ngangimilijarrngay.
Inkoorr-nim nga-ngi-mili=jarrngay. cold-ERG 1-PST-wake.up=1M.DO

(BMF2.015)

‘Cold woke me up.’

In (10.14), there is an ‘extra’ agreement marker; this sentence is an example where the patient shows subject agreement marking and the causer is in the ergative case. However, in addition to the ﬁrst person subject agreement marker, the verb also receives ﬁrst person predicate marking. I assume that the predicate marker is not signaling agreement here, but is signaling topic status (as reﬂected in the jarr- form of the marker, for which see §10.3.2 below).
In summary, though the primary function of these markers is the syntactic marking of direct objects, there are also other functions relating to arguments of the clause.

402 Agreement Morphology

3.2. Forms

Bardi has two sets of direct object clitics which vary in all persons but the third. The forms are given in Table 10.2. The third person singular forms are invariant and not marked; the equivalent of a Set II form for third person appears to be the use of the pronoun jarri (this is discussed further below). The third person augmented Set II forms were given in my 2008 ﬁeld trip but were not accepted on earlier trips; in previous work, the third person augment was invariant and had the form =(i)rr in both sets. The Set II forms are clearly derived from the Set I forms with the addition of jarr.

Set II
=jarrngay =jirri =ø =jarrway =jarrmoord =jarrgoorr [=irr, =jarrirr, =jirrirr]

As mentioned above, these forms are also used for predicative pronouns and attach to nominal predicates. (10.15) is an example. (The semblative case is here used clausally to situate the event in time; see further §5.5.3.)

3.2.1. Allomorphy conditions on object markers
The two sets of direct object markers have the same syntactic functions, in that they both mark direct objects and occasionally other functions described

Direct object agreement 403

above. However, there has been some doubt in previous work on Bardi regarding the conditions on appearance of the agreement sets. In one account (Aklif 1993a), the forms are said to be conditioned by syllable structure: Set I forms are used following vowels, while Set II are used after consonants. This is illustrated in (10.16):

(10.16)

a. Injalalagaljarrngay. I-n-jalala-gal=jarrngay. 3-TR-see-REDUP-REC.PST=1M.DO
‘He’s staring at me.’ b. Inimbinangay.
i-ni-m-bi-na=ngay 3-TR-PST-poke-REM.PST=1M.DO
‘He poked me.’

Metcalfe (1975b) gives a different account, though still arguing for a phonological distribution. He argues that Set I forms are used on evennumbered syllabic stems, while Set II forms are used on odd-numbered stems. This generalization ﬁts the data in (10.16), along with the forms in (10.17a).

(10.17)

a. “Arra goolarrjargajanjarrngay nganga,” injoonoojirr. “Arra goo-l-arr-jarga=jan=jarrngay NEG 2-IRR-AUG-fear-FUT=1MIN.IO=1M.DO nga-nga,” i-n-joo-noo=jirr. 1MIN-‘name’ 3-TR-do/say-REM.PST=3AUG.IO

‘“Don’t be scared, it’s me,” he said to them.’

Anyngarr mi-na-gal=jarrngay

goorlil.

in.vain 2-TR-give-REC.PST=1M.DO turtle

‘You gave me turtle without getting anything in return.’

The phonological explanations of distributions do not account for all the data, however. Firstly, neither of the accounts which are based on phonological criteria account for all the data; there are numerous exceptions to both. Some are given in (10.18) and (10.19). In (10.18), for example, the stem does not have the correct number of syllables for the even/odd distribution rule to work, while in (10.19), the stem ends in the ‘incorrect’ segment for the

404 Agreement Morphology

rule which explains allomorphy as dependent on whether the stems ends in a consonant or a vowel.

An additional argument against a phonological distribution is that the Set I forms have both vowel-initial and consonant-initial allomorphs, as given in Table 10.2 above. Finally, compare the sentences in (10.20). Here we have the same verb root, but different object agreement clitics.

Direct object agreement 405

b. Anajarrngay! A-n-a=jarrngay! 2.IMP-TR-give-FUT=1M.DO
‘Give it to me!’

This minimal pair points to a syntactic distribution of the two Sets rather than a phonological one. The conditions on distribution cannot be metrical; nor can they be based on the ﬁnal segment of the stem, since in (10.20) the stems are identical. In (10.20a) the direct object is present. In (10.20b) the object is omitted or implied from context. In this command, using =jarrngay forms with the DO present leads to an ungrammatical (or at least pragmatically very odd) sentence:143

(10.21) */?? A-n-a=jarrngay o˙ola! 2-give=1m.DO water
‘Give me water!’

This ungrammaticality is most easily explained by assuming the function of the Set II morphemes is to mark object prominence, and more speciﬁcally, topics. The jarr forms are used when the object is the topic of the clause. It is found especially when a topic is maintained over several clauses, where it is easier to see the topic continuity.144 Some examples are given in (10.22) below. These examples illustrate the topical use of jarr- forms in texts. (10.22b) shows contrastive topic marking.

In contrast, in (10.23) we see examples of the non-topic marked object agreement clitics. In (10.23a) we can see that the object agreement cannot be the topic of the clause. The next question in the text is ‘are you deaf?’, implying that the speaker is questioning whether the hearer is ‘listening’, not whether she is listening to the speaker. Furthermore, nganyji marks polar questions where topic of the sentence is the action of the clause, not an individual consituent. (=(G)arda marks the topic of polar questions when individual constituents are questioned.)

‘That’s enough, don’t give me too much.’

In (10.23d), the important part of the clause is the ‘too much’, not the recipient of the items, but the fact that the person is getting too much. This reﬂects the lack of Set II marking on the DO.
There are two questions remaining. Why do we not see these contrasts in third person forms, and why do we get both sets of marking in elicited sentences, where we would not expect topic marking to apply? That is, why did previous researchers assume that the use of Set I versus Set II is governed by phonology? I suspect that topic marking is not marked on the verb for third person objects because third person topic marking is usually marked by omission. That is, third person forms are only overtly realized when they are either focused or reintroduced topics. There are also other, rather complex, ways of marking topic-hood in third person forms, including the use of free pronouns and demonstratives such as jarri ‘this’ (for which see further below). See Bowern (2008a) for further discussion. Set II (jarr) forms appear fairly frequently in elicited sentences, and I assume that this is what led Aklif and Metcalfe to seek a phonological (rather than syntactic) solution to the use of these forms. Elicitation creates its own discourse contexts, however, especially when the sentences keep the same participants across clauses.
Set II jarr-marked forms also seem to occur more frequently when the subject of the clause is third person. (10.22a) above is an example of this; another example is (10.24).

(10.24) “Warrboonim innyankaljarrngay,” injoonin aambina.

‘“Warrboo grabbed me,” she told her husband.’ [That is, Warrboo

(L85.014)

This example shows that the characterization of jarr- is not focus marking, even though the marker involves the marking of prominence of a sort. In

408 Agreement Morphology
this example, the name Warrboo is in the clausal focus position. (For the interaction between clausal constituent order and focus marking, see Bowern (2008a) and §15.1.3.1 below.)

3.2.2. Relation to jarr(i) ‘this’

There is a demonstrative jarr(i) ‘this’ (or ‘these’) which functions as a topic tracker and discourse marker (it is discussed in §7.8). The Set II forms are transparently based on the Set I forms with the addition of jarr, so it is tempting to relate the Set II forms to a historical compound of the demonstrative and the DO agreement markers.145
Jarri has some syntactic oddities. For example, almost all the exceptions to the case marking placement rules occur with it. Case marking consistently occurs on the ﬁrst word of the noun phrase, except for phrases introduced by jarri, where it is possible (through not obligatory) for the case marker to occur on the following word. Thus there are examples such as jarri aamba-nim ‘this man-ERG’ which alternate with jarri-nim aamba). Some examples of the use of jarri as a free pronoun are given in (10.25) below. Note that in these sentences all the noun phrases containing jarri are also topics. This is consistent with the Set II agreement marking described above, in which the objects which showed the marking were also topics or exhibited prominence of some sort.

(BMF.017)

In (10.25a), a balili boy is a boy who has been through the arnkooy initiation ceremony. Although this is the ﬁrst line of a text, the balili boys are already old information, as the storyteller had just been discussing them, and the narrative is a continuation in Bardi of the English conversation. In (10.25b), the topic is contrastive, in a discussion of different types of ﬁsh, this species of ﬁsh, in contrast to one or more of the others that we have been talking about, are not eaten by children alone. Example (10.25c) is also contrastive, with the speaker contrasting himself with the expectation of who might be coming back.

4. Oblique and possessive agreement
Nyulnyulan languages also have a set of oblique clitics. They fulﬁl a number of different functions, including indirect object marking and goal marking.146 In Bardi, the oblique clitics ﬁll two additional roles. The language does not have any dative case marking (which the other languages of the family do have). Arguments which are dative case-marked in other Nyulnyulan languages show oblique agreement in Bardi. Furthermore, possessors may be marked on the verb, and may co-occur with oblique agreement. Etymologically, the oblique clitics are closely related to the free dative/possessive pronouns, for which see §7.4 above. The oblique markers and possessives are formally identical.

410 Agreement Morphology

4.1. Forms

The Bardi oblique paradigms are given in Table 10.3. Like direct object marking, oblique marking also shows two sets of forms which vary by topic status. Very few Set II forms have been recorded in spontaneous use. The free possessive forms are given for comparison.

Table 10.3. Oblique pronominal paradigms

=(j)an =jiy =(j)in =jow =jard =joogarra =jirr

Set II =jarran

[=jirrirr]

It seems that the same rules that govern the jarr- forms for the predicate markers also govern the choice of oblique agreement. Note, however, that the predicate markers do not have a third person minimal Set II form, whereas the oblique markers do show such a form. The topic structures that were discussed for the direct object clitics in §10.3.2.1 also apply to these oblique forms. The topic continuity forms are much rarer for the oblique pronouns than they are for direct object forms. In Aklif (1999), the only attested forms were 1MIN and 3MIN. Subsequent elicitation increased the paradigm but not all forms could be recovered, and the form for the third person augmented Set II allomorph was not accepted by all speakers. Examples are given in (10.26).

(L100.008)

First and third person minimal forms have been recorded both with and without their initial consonant. For example, the verb translating ‘he said to him’ is variably recorded as injoonoojin147 and injoonin. Speakers are unable to point to any different in meaning between the two verb forms and treat them as semantically identical.

4.2. Distribution and function

Oblique objects are characterized by an agreeing oblique pronominal clitic on the verb and zero marking on the free nominal or pronoun (if present). In (10.28) below, the oblique on the verb and its coreferential free noun are in bold.

(10.28) Baawanim inanggagaljin mayi aamba.

Baawa-nim i-na-ng-ga-gal=jin

mayi aamba.

child-ERG 3-TR-PST-bring-REC.PST=3MIN.IO tucker man.

‘The child brought food for the man.’ (Aklif 1994a:BE: E0/2)

The distribution of the oblique pronouns in Bardi is affected (and differentiated from the other Nyulnyulan languages) by the fact that dative marking is null. That is, in the Eastern languages, datives are marked by the sufﬁx -ji (which only marks causals in Bardi; see §5.3.3). In Bardi, verbal crossreference marking replaces the function of the case marker.

412 Agreement Morphology

There are several functions of oblique agreement. The most common is the marking of animate goals, as shown in (10.29):

(10.29)

a. Goolboong inoongooloogaljanan. Goolboo-ng i-noo-ngooloo-gal=janan. rock-INS 1-TR-[PST]-throw-REC.PST=1MIN.IO

2-TR-throw.away-APPL=1M.DO

‘Why are you telling me this, you’re the one that gave me

(BGM.008)

Another use is in the construction of an intransitive verb with ergative subject marking (discussion can be found in §5.3.1):

(10.30) Baawanim inyjargijin ngaarri.

Baawa-nim i-ny-jargi=jin

ngaarri.

child-ERG 3-PST-fear=3MIN.IO devil.

‘The child was afraid of the devil.’

In a few examples, the cause of the action appears with an oblique clitic. In (10.31), for example, the literal meaning is ‘you were not breaking yourselves over me’.

Oblique and possessive agreement 413

(Metcalfe 1975b:5)

The IO marker is also used for human arguments who are affected in some way by the action of the clause, but who do not directly participate. The ablative, which is used for nonhuman participants in equivalent roles, is ungrammatical here.

414 Agreement Morphology

Oblique agreement can mark benefactive roles. In (10.34), for example, =jirrirr cross-references the people for whom a dance is being performed.

(10.34) Boorrboorr ingirrinjirrirrin.

There are also forms which are ambiguous between possessives and benefactives:

(10.35) Mooloo anarajan! Mo˙oloo a-n-ar-a=jan! lice 2.IMP-TR-spear-FUT=1MIN.IO

‘All my things got all wet.’ [The things got wet on me.]

For possessives see §10.4.3 below. However, there were also examples in Aklif’s notes where plain benefac-
tives were said to be ungrammatical. This may be a change in the language, since similar sentences which I elicited (such as (10.38)) were said to be grammatical.

(10.37)

* Store-ngan arr i-n-joo-gal=jan. store-ALL go 3min-do/say-pst=1m.IO ‘He went to the store for me.’

Finally, the oblique clitics mark ethic datives (that is, an affected argument, but not necessarily one which beneﬁts from an action).

(10.39) Aambanim boor inamboogaljin goorlil.

Aamba-nim boor i-na-m-boo-gal=jin

4.3. Possessors
Bardi exhibits an interesting phenomenon, not attested to my knowledge in other Nyulnyulan languages (and rare elsewhere in the world), that possessive pronouns migrate from the DP to the verb. The forms used for possessive marking on the verb are identical to the oblique pronouns, but the slot is different, since it is possible for oblique agreement and possessors to cooccur. As far as can be determined, the marking of possession on the verb is not obligatory, and it can alternate with marking within the noun phrase.
The most common example of possessor marking on verbs occurs with the possessor of a direct object, as in (10.41) below, where the ﬁrst person minimal possessor =jan is cliticized to the verb.148
(10.41) Ginyingginim injoogooloojan daanggoo. Ginyinggi-nim i-n-joogooloo=jan daanggoo. 3MIN-ERG 3-TR-break-1M.POSS jaw
‘He broke my jaw.’
While (10.41) shows a possessor with a direct object, cross-referencing of possessors of other arguments is also possible. (10.42a) shows a subject, and (10.42b) shows an oblique object. (10.42c) shows an example of a possessor combined with a goal.

Possessor raising is thus possible with several different types of arguments, although it does not seem to be grammatical with adjuncts.

5. Quantitative enclitics
In addition to the pronominal agreement described in the previous sections, we also ﬁnd a type of marking on Bardi verbs which is sensitive to quantiﬁcation. The two most common forms in my corpus are =nid and =(b)al. =nid refers to a large group, while =al or =bal denotes an indeﬁnite number.
These clitics do not ﬁt easily into the other types of agreement, since their reference is contextually determined (that is, they may refer to either subject or object arguments on occasion). They also appear to occupy the same slot in the verb as markers such as =jangarr, which may limit not only arguments but the scope of the verbal action itself. While the quantiﬁers most often appear on verbs, they may also occasionally occur on other items in the clause. Finally, such marking is not obligatory; this is unlike subject or oblique argument marking. It is thus better to treat these markers not strictly as ‘agreement’ markers, where features of nominal arguments cross-reference free arguments, but another type of marker which introduces quantiﬁcation, which may attach pragmatically to more than one element in the clause. Such marking is reminiscent of the category of pluractionality (Conathan and Wood 2003, Wood 2008), in which event plurality may surface either as repetition

Quantitative enclitics 417
of the event with the same participants, or repetition of an event with multiple distinct participants.149

5.1. ‘Group’: =nid

The clitic =nid means a ‘group’ or ‘heap’ of something, and is used to refer to items which occur in piles, or in large numbers. Usually =nid refers to the number of the object, and this is illustrated in (10.43):

Metcalfe (1975b:40) says that =nid is a separate word that triggers deletion of the object agreement clitic. It is also found in the Laves texts as a separate word, as shown in (10.47):

There are no examples in my corpus of =nid co-occurring with overt object agreement marking. In both Metcalfe’s texts and the Laves materials, however, there are a few examples where the verb takes third person augment agreement and nid or nidi is a separate word. (10.47) above is from the Laves collection and shows this. An example from one of Metcalfe’s texts is given in (10.48) below:

In modern Bardi, however, arguments marked by =nid take singular marking and such examples are judged ungrammatical. This is shown in examples such as (10.49), where the argument appears as both an object and a subject of a neighboring verb. In this case, not only is augmented direct object agreement marking absent from the ﬁrst verb, but subject agreement on the second verb is third person minimal.

While =nid in the modern corpus almost always occurs cliticized to the verb, it does occasionally occur on other parts of speech as well. Of the 82 examples in my text corpus, =nid appeared on verbs 73 times. The other examples were on possessive pronouns (once each on jirra ‘their’ and jina ‘his/hers/its’) and on the nominal irrganbala ‘appears, looks like’ (seven times). Examples are given below:

5.2. ‘Indeﬁnite’: =(b)al

A second type of quantiﬁer on verbs marks the object as unindividuated and/or indeﬁnite. This clitic =(b)al possibly comprises two clitics, =b and =al, at least historically. -al is attested on nouns as a marker of indeﬁniteness (see §5.1 above for examples), and =b(a) is the relative clause marker; however, although there is no clear phonological conditioning for when =al occurs and when the form is =bal, there is no clear syntactic conditioning either. Here they are treated as the same morpheme, though it is possible that two morphemes have been conﬂated.150
Semantically, =(b)al marks objects which are both indeﬁnite and nonindividuated. In (10.52), for example, the object lagoorr ‘egg(s)’ is nonreferential; this is a generic statement about lizard eggs, not any particular eggs.

Unlike =nid, this quantiﬁer can co-occur with third person augment agreement marking. In (10.53), for example, the verb -ngoorribi- ‘chase’ is inﬂected for both =bal and the object agreement =irr:

(BUR.004)

This clitic is also found in the Laves materials, where it is written as attached to the verb. However, its meaning is unclear; in (10.54), for example, the object of the verb is gooyarra aamba ‘two men’; the object is speciﬁc and individuated. In this case, it is the subject baybirrarranim ‘the people behind’ which is indeﬁnite.

amples of this clitic where they occur on items other than a verb. In (10.55), baybirr ‘behind, following’ is most probably an adverb.151

Chapter 11 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking
Bardi verbs exhibit multiple afﬁxes marking tense, aspect, and mood, both preﬁxal and sufﬁxal. There is a single TAM preﬁx slot, but multiple markers for tense/aspect sufﬁxes. The system of tense marking in Bardi is based on a four-way temporal/modal split in the preﬁxes and a more nuanced tense/aspect system in the sufﬁxes. The tense, aspect, and mood of a verb also conditions the form of some of the person agreement markers. In preﬁxation, tense and mood are mutually exclusive and are marked morphologically in the same places in the paradigm, while in the verbal sufﬁxes, tense and aspect are bound together but can be marked in several ways. There are co-occurrence restrictions between preﬁxes and sufﬁxes. Contrastive sufﬁxal marking of aspect, for example, appears to be neutralized in the irrealis.
There is also aspect marking by choice of light verb in complex predicates; that is, in some cases the choice of light verb forces a particular aspectual interpretation. This chapter primarily describes morphological marking within simple verbs. The chapter is organized around the morphology of the Bardi verbal word. §11.1 describes the preﬁxes, while §11.2 describes the sufﬁxes. §11.3 describes gerundial verb forms, which neutralize the TAM system.
1. Tense and mood preﬁxation
Recall from Figure 9.2 and §9.1.1 above that there are four tense/mood preﬁxes in the verb: present (null), past ng-, future ngg-, and irrealis la-. Recall also that person marking can interact with tense/mood; that is, there are different allomorphs of the second and third person future/irrealis forms. The following sections recap the forms of the preﬁxes and describe the semantics of tense/mood marking. Tense/aspect/mood preﬁx and sufﬁx interactions are described with the sufﬁxes, in §11.2.
1.1. Past
The past tense preﬁx is ng- or nga- in Bardi, as in all Western Nyulnyulan languages. In the minimal forms of stop-initial roots, the morpheme assim-

424 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking
ilates in place of articulation to a following stop, as shown in (11.1). Some basic description was also given in §9.2 above.
(11.1) a. inambarndinggal ‘He covered it with something.’ (root: -barndi-) b. inyjarralana ‘He was running.’ (root: -jarrala-)
Remember that in j-initial roots, only the intransitive forms show the assimilation, since the j-initial transitive roots are irregularly marked only for the transitivity preﬁx in both present and past.
(11.2) injoogoolij ‘he/she/it broke it, he/she/it is breaking it.’
In transitive l-initial roots there is a difference between present and past tense forms, but the difference does not appear in the tense marker directly; rather, the difference is marked in whether the transitive preﬁx n(a)- appears. For example, the third person minimal present of -lamanka- ‘listen to’ is i-lamanka, while the past is i-na-lamanka. Likewise, the present of -laba‘have, hold, possess’ is i-laba-n, while the past is i-na-laba-n(a). Thus there is a still a paradigmatic distinction between present and past forms, though it is not marked directly through the past tense preﬁx. In examples in the grammar which contain verbs like this, I have glossed the morphemes as they appear. Thus i-laba-n is glossed as 3-have-CONT and i-na-laba-n as 3-TRhave-CONT, and the reader must infer from the translation that the ﬁrst is present and the second past152 (free translations also disambiguate). Presumably the difference in forms results from a sound change where nasals were deleted before a following lateral, and *inlaban > ilaban while *inanglaban > inalaban. If these forms are the result of sound change rather than morphological regularization or suppletion, however, the change must have occurred in Proto-Nyulnyulan, since similar irregularities are found in other languages.
Present and past forms are distinct in all intransitive roots apart from those beginning with ng (e.g. -ngalga- ‘cry’), but ng-initial roots are very infrequent. In such roots the past tense marker coalesces with the initial consonant of the root:
(11.3) ingalgan ‘he was crying/he is crying’ < i-ng-ngalga-n (past) or i-ngalga-n (present)
For other nasal-initial roots, the forms are irregular. Mostly, present forms show a nasal-nasal cluster, and the past forms have an epenthetic nasal, as illustrated in (11.4):

Tense and mood preﬁxation 425

(11.4)

a. I-n-marra-n 3-TR-cook-CONT ‘He/she is cooking it.’
b. I-na-marra-n 3-TR-cook-CONT ‘He/she cooked it.’

All m-initial and transitive ng-initial roots behave this way, and the majority of nasal-initial roots begin with m. I assume that the preﬁx bundle underlying the present forms is i-n-, that is, person marker and transitive marker, and that underlying the past forms is i-na-ng-, with the velar nasal assimilating to the place of articulation of the nasal of the root, as in (11.1) and (11.3). However, roots beginning with ny show a third pattern; they show the transitive marker n- in both present and past forms:

(11.5) i-n-nya-n 3-TR-catch-CONT ‘he/she/it catches/caught it.’

There are no roots beginning with n or rn in Bardi. There are some in the other Nyulnyulan languages, but they do not have Bardi cognates.
The past preﬁx is used straightforwardly to mark past time. Preﬁxed forms may occur either in conjunction with a tense sufﬁx, or without one. When they occur without a tense sufﬁx, they have generic past reference.

1.2. Present

The form of the present preﬁx marker is null in all forms. For stop-initial intransitive roots, this causes lenition of that stop; orthographically, b becomes w, and j and g become y.

(11.6)

a. i-yama 3-laugh ‘he/she/it is laughing’ (root -gama- ‘laugh’)
b. nga-warra 1-dream ‘I’m dreaming’ (root -barra- ‘dream’)

426 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking
In the augment forms, the person and number occur immediately adjacent to each other:
(11.7) i-rr-irli-n 3-AUG-eat-CONT ‘They are eating.’
Present forms are used for present time (that is, time at the moment of speech) and can also be used for aoristic statements (that is, those expressing general truths), though the future is also found in such cases. Further discussion is provided under the section on null sufﬁxing, in §11.2.1.1 below.
1.3. Future and imperative
The Bardi ‘future’ preﬁx is used to mark future time and some types of wishes. It is also used for imperative marking, and probably also for deontic marking more generally (though this function is split between the future and the irrealis, described in §11.1.4).
1.3.1. Form
In the augmented forms, where the future preﬁx is clear between the person marker and the augment marker, the preﬁx has the form ngg-. ‘We will cook it,’ for example, is a-ngg-arr-a-marra. Intransitive forms are also straightforward and point to a morpheme of this shape. In transitive minimal forms, however, the future marker appears to combine with the transitive morpheme n-, and the marker is nk-. Stem changes are also triggered in stop-initial verbs. In oonkowa, for example, the marker of future is k rather than ngg.
(11.8) oonkowa oo-n-k-o-wa 3-TR-FUT-poke-FUT
‘He/she’ll poke it.’
Second person minimal and third person (both minimal and augmented) forms vary for future marking. Second person forms also vary for transitivity.

Tense and mood preﬁxation 427

The preﬁx is a- for transitive verbs, and nga- for intransitive ones, as illustrated by the pair in (11.9). Second person augment imperatives and futures have the form arr-.

(11.9) a. a-n-jala! ‘look at it!’ b. nga-yarrala! ‘run!’

The third person marker is oo- in the future (and irrealis) rather than i-, which is used in the present and past.
Finally, there is one phonological condition under which the future marker can be deleted. When there is a ﬁrst or second person minimal subject with an intransitive verb beginning with g-, the future preﬁx is in the position where it is the target of deletion through nasal dissimilation (discussed in §3.6.4). In that case, the nasal of the preﬁx is deleted when a nasal appears in the previous syllable, and the stop of the preﬁx is deleted because it is identical to the initial stop of the verb root. (11.10) provides an example. The underlying morphemic structure is given beneath the verb.

1-TR-do-CONT
‘I am going to sit in the sun, as I am feeling cold.’
This rule is optional, and is more common in some speakers than others; thus there are forms in the corpus which show the regular future marking in such cases (an example of the same verb, where the future marker is present, can be seen in (11.21) below).

1.3.2. Future meanings
The main use of the future preﬁx is to refer to a time that has not yet happened. This time may be in the remote future, or closer to the present. That is, the future preﬁx is also used for events which are about to happen. (This

428 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking

is in contrast to some Australian languages where immediate future events receive present verbal marking.) (11.11) shows a general future statement, while (11.12) show examples of future markers which are much closer to the moment of speaking.

NEG=THUS go 1-IRR-do-FUT

For the use of the future in (11.12b), see below. The second main group of ‘future’ uses do not directly involve temporal
reference. Some examples of future tense preﬁxing mark statements of general fact and do not appear to refer speciﬁcally to future time, though the future is included in the scope of the temporal reference. In (11.13), for example, the statement that when a person dies, their spirit travels to Looman (the land of the dead, in the West), can be presumed to apply not only to future deaths, but to past ones as well. Many of the gnomic future examples (including the one illustrated in (11.13) below) occur in the Laves texts, and while they were accepted, equivalent sentences were seldom produced spontaneously; instead, the present was used. However, there are many examples of futures used in the sense exempliﬁed by (11.14), where the sense of the clause is not just that the action must take place for this speciﬁc turtle, but this is the right way to cook all turtles.

A slightly different type of example is given in (11.15) below, where the statement expressed is something like an expectation, rather than a statement of what usually happens in such circumstances.

‘The paddle will keep you up. [Metcalfe’s gloss]’

(M.Dict)

Future tense forms are also common after imperative clauses, where the future describes the result of the action in the imperative. In (11.16), for example, there is no overt marker for the result clause.

(11.16) Yaalnga anama yaaga aarli ankalangjirr.

2IMP-TR-FUT-see-APPL=3A.IO

‘Chuck the grease in the pool so we two will be able to see the ﬁsh in the pool.’

The future can be used for hypothetical statements. This is particularly common after verbs of asking, as shown in (11.17). In these examples, I do

430 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking

not have the requisite information to be able to determine whether the second verb is syntactically dependent on the ﬁrst. Given the agreement facts in sentences such as (11.17), it would appear that these clauses have more in common with indirect questions than with juxtaposed clauses. In (11.17b), for example, the verb of the second clause is third person minimal (that is ‘ask him if he will lend me. . . ’); if the request were direct, we would expect second person subject marking (‘ask him: (you) lend me the tape’). Both examples are also marked with the allative/purposive case.

‘Ask him if he will lend me the videotape!’

The ﬁnal use of future preﬁxing in the corpus involves sequence of tense marking. In (11.18), there are three clauses. The ﬁrst is expository (‘here is a turtle track’), the second explains where the turtle went, and the third (dependent on the second and introduced by =jamb ‘thus’) explains the purpose of the event in the second clause. In this case, although the event is in the past, the verb of the last clause is marked for future, because the time is relative with respect to the second clause.

It is probable that the same sequence of tense parameters are responsible for the future marking in (11.19):

(L145.016)

1.3.3. Imperative and hortative meanings

Imperatives and futures are not distinguished morphologically; however, they are distinguished intonationally. Subjects may surface (and they receive ergative marking where appropriate). That is, imperative sentences behave just like regular future clauses syntactically (see also (12.77) below). Most often the subject is omitted, however, as in (11.16). (11.20) shows an example where the free subject pronoun is present:

(11.20)

3MIN.FUT-IRR-listen.to-1M.DO

‘[You] tell him to stop; he doesn’t listen to me.’ (Aklif 1993b:3)

Second person imperatives are the most common; ﬁrst and third person forms (also identical to the future) were elicited, and usually translated with ‘I gotta’ or ‘he gotta.’

It should be noted that although positive imperatives are formed with future preﬁxes, negative imperatives are distinct. Negative imperatives follow regular negative marking and are treated as negative irrealis future clauses. Thus they do not receive future preﬁxing.

1.4. Irrealis
Irrealis-marked verbs are rather common. All clausal negation forces the verb into the irrealis, for example (see (11.20) above). In form, the irrealis is marked with the preﬁx l(a)-, which occupies the same slot in the preﬁx complex as the tense markers. Irrealis is also marked within the subject person marker, where the third person form is i- in present and past but oo- in future and irrealis.

Tense and mood preﬁxation 433
The irrealis has a number of different functions in Nyulnyulan languages. Wagner (1997) and McGregor and Wagner (2006) provide a detailed discussion and analysis for Nyulnyulan languages in general, including examples from Bardi.

1.4.1. Possible worlds

Apart from its use in negated clauses (discussed in §11.1.4.3 below), the most common use of the irrealis is to describe possible worlds, that is, things that might happen, or unrealizable wishes, as illustrated in (11.25) below:

(11.25) Anjala! Joorroonim oolarlarri.

A-n-jal-a!

Joorroo-nim oo-la-rl-a=rri.

2.IMP-TR-look-FUT snake-ERG 3-IRR-eat/bite-2M.DO

‘Look out! The snake might bite you.’

The irrealis is also used to express wishes. I have no data on whether there is any difference in marking between attainable and unattainable wishes. I suspect there is no difference in Bardi, at least in the morphology.

(11.26) Gaadiliny ngalarlin laalbooyoon.
Gaadiliny nga-la-rli-n laalboo-yoon. monkey.ﬁsh 1-IRR-eat-CONT earth.oven-SOURCE

‘I would like to eat monkey ﬁsh from an earth oven.’

McGregor and Wagner (2006) provide a range of semantic contexts for irrealis marking, including counterfactuals, wishes, and hypothesized events (as discussed here). They suggest from data from other Nyulnyulan languages that there is a difference between irrealis present marking and irrealis future marking for signaling wishes, and that the future irrealis marking suggests that the occurrence of the event is undesirable. I have no data on whether this is true for Bardi.
The irrealis is also used for hypotheses. McGregor and Wagner (2006:356) describe this use as ‘uninformed expectation’; that is, the speaker is uncommitted to the occurrence of the situation. There are no examples in the corpus that ﬁt this meaning exactly, though Bardi does have cases where speakers discuss hypotheses about particular events, as in (11.27):

‘They must have thought that they were a wife exchange.’(L150.016)

1.4.2. Counterfactual

Events that could have happened, but didn’t (that is, past counterfactuals) are also marked with the irrealis. Counterfactuals are rare in the corpus, but examples appear in both the older and modern texts, as exempliﬁed below. I have no information about tense interactions with counterfactual readings. Example (11.28) is a past counterfactual, with remote past sufﬁxal marking, while (11.29) is an unrealized wish, with continuous aspect marking. It differs from (11.26), however, by the fact that the wish expressed in (11.26) is realizable (at least in principle), while that in (11.29) is not.153

(JNB.014)

Tense/aspect sufﬁxation 435

1.4.3. Negation

The most frequent use of the irrealis, however, is in negated clauses. All sentential negation forces irrealis marking on the verb, in all tenses. The examples in (11.30) are representative.

(11.30)

‘Tell me again. I didn’t hear you.’

c. Arra ngalalaba goolboo. Arra nga-la-laba goolboo. NEG 1-IRR-have money.

‘I don’t have any money.’

I follow McGregor and Wagner (2006) in assuming that the negative function of irrealis marking follows from its connection with ‘non-actual’ world marking. That is, if an event did not happen, it is not part of the real world, and so is marked with irrealis, just as counterfactuals and other statements about possible and un-real worlds. Negation strategies are further discussed in §15.3.1.

2. Tense/aspect sufﬁxation
The tense/aspect sufﬁxes in Bardi (as in all Nyulnyulan languages) are portmanteau morphemes which signal a combination of tense and aspect. There are several slots for these afﬁxes; applicative marking, for example, intervenes between them. Several tense/aspect sufﬁxes can appear simultaneously,

436 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking

to produce ﬁner distinctions. They are thus quite different from the preﬁxes, which are purely time/mood markers.
There is a reduction of tense/aspect sufﬁx use in the future and irrealis. In the future, only -a or -ø can be used. In the irrealis, sufﬁxation is conﬁned to remote past -na, the future -a, zero marking, and the continuative -n. That is, the ﬁner aspectual distinctions found in present and past forms are not found in the future and irrealis. The forms for Bardi are given in Table 11.1. (The use of the term ‘slot’ here is informal.) The ﬁrst two markers also have allomorphs; when they combine, the form is -na-n or -na-na (see further below). The future sufﬁx usually replaces the ﬁnal vowel of the stem, but not always; monosyllabic verbs with a vowel in i or oo may retain their vowel and in that case there is glide insertion between the root and the future sufﬁx.

In addition to the sufﬁxes here, very occasionally verb roots (whether further inﬂected or not) end in -i rather than their usual stem vowel. An example is given in (11.31). The verb root ‘catch’ is usually -nya-, but here it appears in the form nyi instead. Such examples are not frequent enough to suggest that there is another sufﬁx in play, and they occur almost entirely in the speech of David Wiggan, suggesting that this might be a feature of his speech style.
(11.31) Ngoorra daab innyi! Ngo˙orra daab i-n-nyi! last.night climb.up 3-TR-catch
‘He climbed up (here) last night.’

Tense/aspect sufﬁxation 437
2.1. Usage of sufﬁxes
Most of the data on Bardi tense/aspect marking comes from narratives and elicited sentences. Thus we have extensive examples of various past tense markers and their relation to aspect marking, but only elicited data and the conversations reported in stories for other tense/aspect combinations.
As mentioned above, there is some evidence for a relative tense system in Bardi, and certain subordinate clause types appear to show sequence of tense effects (contra McGregor and Wagner 2006). Data are somewhat limited, however, since subordination is quite rare, and clause chaining is a much more frequent device for showing dependency relations between clauses.

2.1.1. Zero marking

Unsufﬁxed verb forms are quite rare in my data. They are much more common in closely related languages (e.g. Nyulnyul: see numerous examples in McGregor (in press) and Nekes and Worms (1953)). Examples in Bardi appear to occur particularly in clause chaining, although they do not have to (furthermore, clause chaining verbs are often marked with a tense sufﬁx). Additionally, they can describe a general state of affairs, one that holds not only in the present, but in general. They are also fairly common in song language. More examples in spontaneous speech appeared in my 2008 ﬁeld trip, which may imply that they are associated with language attrition. Null sufﬁxed forms are not atemporal; they always have the tense preﬁx, and thus temporal marking of a sort. Finally, null sufﬁxed forms occur with past tense preﬁxes to signal a form which is not further speciﬁed for aspect, as in §11.32b below.

(JNK.015)

438 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking

Null-sufﬁxed items occur on occasion in my elicitation data (and also in the data of Gedda Aklif); these are found for events when there is no particular time statement, such as (11.33), where the statement refers to past time (as signaled by the tense preﬁx), but there is no further information.

(11.33)

‘The child was frightened of him.’

(Aklif 1994c:3)

While null sufﬁxal marking can be used to mark general states of affairs, the continuous marker is more usually used for such cases; that is, for events with general relevance, or gnomic statements, as in (11.34).

(11.34) Goonkoonoongg namardamb bool irrjiidin wiiny indan jooroor irrngoogoon.

jooroor i-rr-ngoog-oon.

3-TR-do/say-CONT wind 3aug-stomach-LOC

‘When pufferﬁsh blow up, their stomachs ﬁll up with air.’

Most of the examples of null sufﬁxal marking occur with present or past preﬁxes. It is very rare for future/irrealis preﬁxes to be unmodiﬁed with sufﬁxal marking, though it is possible. (11.35) is an example; if the verb had future sufﬁxation, the verb form would be ngamiyajan.

(11.35) Ngamijan barda gorror arr ngaliya.

Nga-mi=jan

barda gorror arr nga-li-ya.

2MIN.IMP-look.for=1M.IO off if come 1-IRR-do/say-FUT

‘Look for me [before you go], and maybe I’ll go too.’

Tense/aspect sufﬁxation 439

Interestingly, tense/afﬁx sufﬁxation is almost non-existent in Bardi song texts. One occasionally ﬁnds -n or -na used, as in (11.36a), but most verbs are unsufﬁxed (for an example see (11.36b). Many songs are in the present tense, which accounts for some of the lack of sufﬁxation, although the lack of any sufﬁxes is still striking. The following verse of Billy Ah Choo’s ilma shows this; some forms show continuous marking (though in performance not all speakers use the continuous marker here) while other verbs, include birdbag -(i)nya- ‘ﬂash (of lightning)’ exhibit no sufﬁxation.155

(11.36)

a. Booroo nganjanboon ngayoo / Booroo nga-n-janboo-n ngayoo / ground 1-TR-tread-CONT 1MIN

‘I’m stepping on the ground.’

(BAI, 1.1)

b. Ngalaj inngooloon ngayoo birdbag innya / Ngalaj i-n-ngooloo-n ngayoo birdbag lightning 3-TR-throw-CONT — sheet.lightning i-n-nya- / 3-TR-catch-ø

‘Lightning’s ﬂashing, lightning’s ﬂashing.’

(BAI, 2.2)

Such verses do not express general truths; they are short descriptions of speciﬁc events in a story, and so should be seen as different from the gnomic use of null sufﬁxation.

2.2. Continuative: -n

The continuative marker, -n, is used for prolonged actions and for states. When the Aktionsart of the verb is inherently punctual (e.g. -bi- ‘strike’), using the continuative forces an iterative reading. Some examples are given in (11.37), both alone and in combination with other temporal and aspectual sufﬁxes.

(L128.018)

While the primary form of the sufﬁx is -n, there is some evidence for allomorphs -na, -an, and -in in different contexts. The form -na appears when the remote past tense marker follows. This is the only case in which -na is found for -n. The other allomorphs are more difﬁcult to describe. For example, we ﬁnd both injalin and injalan (as well as remote past forms injalina and injalana) for the verb ‘he/she/it saw something’. On the basis of other evidence, we would say that the root is -jala- ‘see’. Some variation in sufﬁx vowels can be explained by vowel harmony; for example, verb forms which are followed by the third person augmented direct object clitic =irr can exhibit harmony, with the ﬁnal vowel of the sufﬁx becoming i, though this is rare. The rules for harmony are, however, rather variable. Some instances of -in are probably null sufﬁxed verbs with the lenited form of the third person oblique marker =(j)in; thus they exhibit a clitic rather than the continuative sufﬁx. Others may be transcription errors, but there are sufﬁcient examples which cannot be explained by either of these arguments that the vowel variation appears to be a real phenomenon. There is, however, no clear conditioning factor, and there is no semantic difference between the two that I can discover. (McGregor (in press) notes a similar problem for Nyulnyul.)
Two conditions cause the sufﬁx to be realized as -rn rather than as -n. The ﬁrst is when the last consonant of the root is the glide -r (e.g. -moonggar‘work’); the other is when there is an apical consonant as the last consonant in the root, there is optional retroﬂex dissimilation (not all speakers have this rule) and the apical of the continuative marker appears as retroﬂex.

Tense/aspect sufﬁxation 441

The continuative marker is obligatory on the gerund (see §11.3), leading Metcalfe (1975b) to argue that the gerund is a circumﬁx. I would prefer to equate the -n sufﬁxal portion of the gerund with the continuative aspect marker, however, although nothing depends on this point. There are no other true circumﬁxes in the language (see arguments regarding the reﬂexive/reciprocal markers in §12.3). One might argue that if the words in question are truly gerunds, we would expect that they are nouns, and therefore without internal temporal structure. Therefore having an aspect marker on them is contradictory, if the sufﬁx is functioning as true aspect marking in those cases. This would be an argument against equating the continuous marker with the sufﬁxal -n of the gerund. On the other hand, if the function of the continuative marker is really to mark the event as not having internal structure, continuous marking is compatible with gerundial marking.
The continuative cannot be used in the future and is conﬁned to cooccurrence with the present, past and gerundial preﬁxes. It can combine with the remote part -na and recent past -gal, and there is a form -inj which is probably the continuative plus the simultaneous action sufﬁx.

When -gal is used with the continuative, it implies that the event lasted a while but is now over. This past use of -n-kal can be compared to the use of -n-kal with present tense preﬁxing, as described in §11.51b.

442 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking

The continuative does not normally co-occur with the future, though there are one or two examples, such as (11.40) below (repeated from (11.13) above). It appears to be more common in the older texts, and in the speech of David Wiggan.

(L74.001)

The combination of the continuative -n with the remote past -na results in -nana or -nan, with both apocope and epenthesis. This afﬁx combination is used for events that had a duration but ﬁnished in the remote past. It is very common in mythological stories.

Occasionally in both the Laves texts and later narratives, verbs appear to have an ‘extra’ tense sufﬁx; there are verb forms such as inanggalananana (parsed in (11.43) below) which appear to have three remote past and continuous sufﬁxes rather than two. I assume that these are either transcription errors or speech errors. The forms that I was able to check against sound ﬁles were transcription errors, but these forms were not commented on by speakers as being incorrect when texts were edited.

2.3. Remote past: -na
It’s hard to deﬁne the exact form of this sufﬁx. Most commonly it appears as -na, though allomorphs of the forms -an, -in, and -ana are also recorded. The

444 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking

forms without ﬁnal vowels are straightforwardly the result of prosodic ﬁnal vowel deletion, but as in the case of the continuative marker, the variation in the epenthetic vowels (that is in forms such as -in and -an) is not explicable at present. Note that ﬁnal vowel loss on a form which contains the remote past but not the continuous sufﬁx results in ambiguity as to which sufﬁx has been used. Continuous and remote past verbs are homophonous in such cases.
In my recent data, the remote past is also the default past tense sufﬁx. It is a purely temporal sufﬁx and appears to provide no aspectual information. While it is especially common in Dreamtime narratives, -na is also the unmarked past tense sufﬁx. It may co-occur with the continuative -n, as seen from (11.41)–(11.42) above.

‘He walked off for food.’156

The sufﬁx is glossed as ‘remote’ past for two reasons. One is to distinguish it from the recent past tense marker -gal or the perfective marker -ij, which it cannot co-occur with. Speakers say that -gal is used for events which are ‘close-up’; -ij is used for ‘middling’ events, while -na is used for ‘long time’ (ago). There is thus some salience to temporal gradience between the three sufﬁxes. The other reason is that speakers described the sufﬁx to Gedda Aklif in the early 1990s as being more remote; thus while I have some more recent examples of the sufﬁx being a fairly neutral, general past tense sufﬁx (used in narration of Frog Story descriptions (Mayer 1969), for example), there is other evidence that until recently ‘remote past’ was a better categorization.

2.4. Recent past: -gal
The morpheme -gal is the grammaticalized form of the independent temporal particle gala, and marks recent past. Gala is very difﬁcult to gloss exactly; translation equivalents include ‘well then’, ‘done!’ or ‘already’. It is the common way to end narrative stories. It is used especially by older people when telling stories to non-ﬂuent researchers, who might otherwise be unable to tell when the story has drawn to a close and they need to turn off the tape recorder:157

Tense/aspect sufﬁxation 445

(11.46) Gala barnkarda! all.right ﬁnished ‘It’s ﬁnished. That’s the end.’

The grammaticalization of -gal as an aspectual morpheme probably arises from sentences such as (11.47a) below. (11.47) shows the grammaticalized and ungrammaticalized uses of -gal/gala. In (11.47a) there are two words, with a slight pause between them, and an intonational rise on the ﬁnal syllable of inamarran, with a sharp fall on gala. In (11.47b), however, there is a single word with falling intonation across the word.

(11.47)

‘She was cooking, then she stopped.’ b. Inamarrankal.
I-na-marra-n-kal. 3-TR-cook-CONT-REC.PST
‘She was cooking for a while [but she isn’t now].’

The sufﬁx is unleniting and unalternating. It is always -gal; in that it is exceptional, in comparison with other sufﬁxes which begin with an obstruent, such as the ‘reason’ marker -ganiny.

2.4.1. Temporal and aspectual semantics of -gal
The morpheme -gal has both temporal and aspectual properties. In temporal terms, it is always used of events that occurred within a day or two of the speech reference. Thus it is incompatible with remote temporal adverbs such as milon ‘a long time ago’, and is frequently used with adverbs such as bardi ‘yesterday’.

Aspectually, verbs marked with -gal and the past tense preﬁx are always completed. For example, in (11.49), which is a series of sentences from a text, the events have just taken place, but they are completed. (The character in the story has just returned after seeing a crocodile.) Because of the sense of completed action, the recent past is also used for habitual or customary actions in the past which are not longer done (that is, actions translated by English ‘used to’).

(CAM1.039)

In (11.49a), the person has just run up to his family, but he has stopped running by the time they ask the question in (11.49a). In (11.49b), he says how he has just seen a crocodile, but he can’t see it anymore. (The person has climbed the hill from the shore where he was down ﬁshing.) In (11.49c), he is describing the situation before he ran away.
The recent past -gal is used particularly often in enumerating events, for example, in listing what a speaker has just done, as in (11.50) below, where each step in the list is complete before the one following.

(11.50) Ginyinggon wirr inyjarrmigal aalga, roowilgidi ngannyagal gaarrangan. Jagoordgidi nganjoogal booroonganjan. Ooldoobal nganjooloonggaljanirr, roowilgid ngannyagal moorrgalnganjan.

While verbs marked with -gal are always completed, and thus perfective in a sense, they are not marked for ‘perfect’ (that is, continuing relevance into the present). This seems to be one of the main differences between verbs marked with -gal and those marked by the perfect sufﬁx -ij, for the latter can be used, in certain circumstances, with a resultative meaning.

448 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking

2.4.2. -gal and present marking

There is a further occasional use of -gal in contexts which imply present reference rather than past. All such examples are used in conjunction with the continuative -n in complex sentences (see §11.2.2). In such cases, -n-kal combines with the present preﬁx.

(11.51)

‘As I was coming along I could smell something; something was stinking.’

In (11.51a) the second clause (arra nimoonggoon morr booroongan) contains no overt indication of tense; there is no verb (nimoonggoon is an inalienably possessed noun meaning ‘knowledge’). There is no overt past tense copula, however. In (11.51b) we see present morphology in the ﬁrst clause, and past in the second (ngangimiligal). Almost all the examples of -n-kal sequences

Tense/aspect sufﬁxation 449
are part of complex sentences and I assume that this represents a sequence of tense effect.
In effect, the distinction between the uses of -n, -nkal, or -gal seems to be a focus on whether the event has an endpoint (-gal), or whether it continues for any length of time (-n), or both (or neither).

2.5. Middle perfect: -ij

In Aklif (1999) and Metcalfe (1975b), the sufﬁx -ij is glossed as a ‘middle perfect,’ implying that the action of the verb is complete and happened earlier than the day of the speech act, but not long enough ago to use the remote past -na. I retain this terminology. Events marked with -ij have a ﬂavor of ‘relevance’, like many perfects. With the exception of (11.55) below, all examples of the middle perfect take past tense preﬁxation.

(11.52) Wirr inyjarrmij goolboon.
Wirr i-ny-jarrm-ij goolb-oon. get.up 3-PST-rise-PFV rock-LOC

‘It got up from the rock.’ (11.53) Boolman imboolmij aarli, anoongoola!
Boolman i-m-boolm-ij aarli, a-noo-ngool-a! rotten 3-PST-smell-PFV ﬁsh, 2-TR-throw-FUT
‘The ﬁsh is rotten—throw it away.’

The middle perfect is used with many emotion verbs to denote continuing resultative states:

(11.54) Loogal injij, anjalala joonim.

450 Tense, Aspect, and Mood Marking

I have a single example of the middle perfect being used with a future preﬁx, given in (11.55) below. Both clauses are in future time, but the second appears to be overtly marked for perfectivity.

(11.55) Ngayoo inngoorr oonggarraya ngay, joogid garrma oonggarrargij.

later 3-FUT-AUG-pick.up-PFV

‘They’ll take me ﬁrst, and they’ll come and pick you up later.’

2.6. Future: -a

The future tense sufﬁx -a may be used with the future or irrealis preﬁxes. It also appears when the future is used as an imperative.

(11.56)

a. Marl arriya! Marl a-rr-iy-a! stop 2-AUG-do/say-FUT

(Imperative)

joo=gid garrma oo-ngg-arr-argi-j.

2MIN=THEN later 3-FUT-AUG-TR-pick.up-SIMUL

‘They’ll take me ﬁrst, and they’ll come and pick you up later.’

The future gives a purely temporal interpretation to irrealis clauses (that is, it appears to be unmarked for aspect). In the irrealis it alternates with the

Tense/aspect sufﬁxation 451
past tense -na. In the future clauses, it sometimes alternates with -ij, where -ij has something of the ﬂavor of a perfect.
No other Nyulnyulan language has a future tense sufﬁx (although Nyikina does have a future habitual -ngani); I have no etymology for Bardi -a. As noted in examples such as (11.35) and (16.27), it can be omitted without loss of future reference, though such examples are rare.

2.7. Simultaneous action: -j ∼ -ji

There is a further sufﬁx which I have termed ‘simultaneous action’. It never occurs without another tense/aspect marker. It is fused with the continuative -n or the recent past -gal in all my examples. This sufﬁx is used to mark actions that occur during (or overlapping with) the action of another related clause. It usually has the form -j, though variants with the form -ji are also recorded, especially in the Laves materials. Unlike most afﬁxes with both vowel- and consonant-ﬁnal allomorphs, however, the forms with the consonant-ﬁnal allomorph are considerably more common than those with the vowel.
The description of the distribution of the simultaneous action sufﬁx may imply that it is a subordinator, and indeed, it is frequently used on verbs which are dependent on another clause (for example, (11.57)). It is, however, also frequently used in main clauses without subordinating function. (11.58) provides an example of this type of use.

3. Gerunds ma- -n
In addition to the inﬂection for tense and subject agreement, Bardi verbs may also be inﬂected with the preﬁx m(a)-, which replaces all other agreement, transitivity, and tense inﬂection. The verbs also have the sufﬁx -n (discussed brieﬂy above under the continuative marker).
3.1. Forms of the afﬁx
The gerund marker has a preﬁxal and a sufﬁxal component, neither of which alternates (though the vowel of the preﬁx component can coalesce; see below). The ma- preﬁx induces lenition in Bardi roots (e.g. mawoon ‘hitting’ < ma-boo-n ‘hit’), which is regular. Some verbs have two forms: compare

Gerunds ma- -n 453

mawooloongan ∼ moloongan from ma-bulu-nga-n ‘to enter’. This appears to show both lenition treatments of *abu; I assume these are dialectal differences. Polysyllabic roots beginning with ba- take the form o- in the gerund; thus the gerund of -banji- ‘share’ is m-onji-n, and has no alternate form *mawanjin.
An additional irregularity in the morphology of gerunds is that vowelinitial roots appear to be inﬂected for the transitivity marker n-.

(11.60)

a. -ibi- ‘drink’ : manibin ‘to drink, drinking’ b. -ar-/-ra-: manaran ‘to spear’ c. -argi-: manargin ‘to pick up’

We could argue that these roots start with n and are not in fact vowelinitial. It would not be possible to tell in any other forms except perhaps the reﬂexive/reciprocal. The reﬂexive of -ar- in Bardi is m-ar-inyji-, not m-nar-inyji- or ma-n-arinyji-, implying that the root is vowel-initial and the n- in the gerund is epenthetic.158
There is indirect evidence that the n- is truly epenthetic in Bardi. There are several Bardi roots which historically began with consonants, usually *w-. The two most common are *-wa- ‘give’ and *-warki- ‘pick up’. In Bardi these roots behave like the other historically vowel-initial roots (e.g. *-ibi- ‘drink’), implying that the ‘epenthetic’ rule has been generalized to roots that it would not have originally applied to.

3.2. Word class of gerunds
The word class of gerunds is problematic. Many of their characteristics are held in common with nominals, however there are also verbal characteristics. On the one hand, they exhibit no tense or transitivity marking or subject agreement. This makes them unlike ﬁnite verbs. They take some nominal derivation (such as the ‘expert’ sufﬁx -iidi (see §5.1.3 and (11.61)), and case marking, such as the comitative case, as illustrated in (11.62). This makes them rather noun-like.

Gerunds can also be arguments of verbs, and of the word arranga ‘without’ (see (11.63a)), another characteristic of nouns.
Although gerunds are noun-like in a number of respects, they are rather un-nounlike in others. While they do not take subject marking, other verbal morphology can be present. Moreover, they also govern arguments. Ergativemarked subjects can appear, and direct object cliticization is also possible. (11.63a) gives an example where the direct object free pronoun irr ‘they’ is doubled by a clitic on the gerund. In (11.63b), the gerund’s object argument is not present, but is implied from the agreement on the inﬂected matrix verb. (11.64) shows an ergative case-marked subject of a gerund.

3.3. Functions of gerunds

Gerunds can be used with adnominal case marking to derive modiﬁers. All such examples are resultative. There are not very many examples and they were difﬁcult to elicit; there appear to be complex constraints on the verbal argument structure which makes a lot of verbs incompatible with this marking (this is a topic for future research).159

Gerunds are also used in the construction +oongoong ma-X-n ‘to like’ (literally ‘be with-stomach for’) and liyan -ma-, which also means ‘like’. As shown in (11.67), +oongoong ‘stomach-INS’ can be used without a light verb; instead, the experiencer (baawa-nim ‘children-ERG’ in (11.67)) appears with ergative case, and an oblique marker appears cliticized to the noun.

‘The kids like moolinj (Glycosmis trifoliata) fruit a lot: it’s good to eat.’

Example (11.66) raises an interesting point about the status of clauses with gerund-marked verbs. The object of marlinngan ‘eating’ is goorlil ‘turtle’, which is initial in the clause. This could imply that the initial focus position is not strictly clause-bound; that is, that arguments from subordinate clauses might be able to be extracted out of their clause.160 Alternatively, it could imply that marlinngan is a noun whose arguments can be individually focused. Individual items in a noun phrase can be focused under certain circumstances (and thus appear as discontinuous), as seen in (8.3); arguments of gerunds could be another example.
Other gerunds are fossilized, and are used just as regular nouns. Speakers do not perceive a relationship between such words and their inﬂecting verbal counterparts.

(11.68) mawooloonngan
ma-wooloo-n-ngan GER-come.in-CONT-ALL

‘ﬂood tide, coming in tide’

The word mawooloonngan is historically a gerund, but in the modern language it acts as a regular noun, as though it were uncompositional.
In Nyulnyul, gerunds are found inﬂected with the nomen agentis -id. There is a form ma-damaned /ma-dam-an-id/ ‘hitter’ in Nekes and Worms (1953), for example, formed from the verb root -dam- ‘hit’. Further examples are found with the source case -joon. This formation is not productive in Bardi, although a few forms do exist (illustrated e.g. in (11.69)). All the inﬂected forms seem to be found in Nekes and Worms (1953), which may imply that they are calqued from neighboring languages, or that they have fallen out of use. Some of these forms were conﬁrmed in elicitation in 2008 but are not found in my corpus of spontaneous speech. A rare example is

Gerunds ma- -n 457

mayooloonganjoon ‘stuff’, which is the gerund of the root -jooloong- ‘collect’ and the source case -joon. It means literally ‘things which have been collected.’

ma- janggole -n -jono ma- janggula -n -junu GER- break -CONT -SRCE

‘a broken thing’

(Nekes and Worms 1953:146)

3.4. Inﬂection

The gerunds are morphologically simpler than inﬂected forms. They have no tense preﬁxes, and only the continuative aspect sufﬁx (which is obligatory). Gerunds are not inﬂected for the transitivity preﬁx. For example, the gerund mamarran means both ‘to cook something’ and ‘to cook (intransitive)’. Bivalent roots omit the transitivity marker in the gerund. The gerund thus replaces all preﬁxal marking on the verb (except for reﬂexive preﬁxes, for which see below).

Liyan nganman mamarranngan aarlimay. Liyan nga-n-ma-n ma-marra-n-ngan aarli-may. feeling 1-TR-put-CONT GER-cook-CONT-ALL food.

(Bowern 2011:3/89)

Reﬂexive marking can also occur on gerunds. Spontaneous examples such as (11.71) occur, and elicited examples were also produced.

Chapter 12 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity
Nyulnyulan languages do not have common valency-changing derivations, such as passives and antipassives, although they do have several different morphological and syntactic means of changing the transitivity of a verb stem and the argument structure of a predicate. Reﬂexive/reciprocal marking is morphologically marked on the verb, and there are several applicative sufﬁxes which alter the valency of the root or the transitivity of the stem.
Valency and transitivity are thorny areas of Bardi syntax. The problems of analysis are compounded by several different factors. The free omission of arguments (especially topics) makes it difﬁcult to determine whether a verb such as inarlij means ‘s/he ate [it]’ (transitive with omitted object) or ‘s/he ate’ (semitransitive). These questions were discussed with speakers but the results were not conclusive. The presence of multiple case frame possibilities for both superﬁcially transitive and intransitive verbs means that it is impossible to use case marking as a simple diagnostic for transitivity. Finally, there are mismatches between the morphology of the predicate (in complex predicates) and the number of arguments which appear to be licensed in the clause.
Just as in other areas of the grammar, valency-changing morphology shows some irregularity and unproductivity. In this case it has clearly been compounded by language attrition in the last speakers. When I returned to One Arm Point in 2008 to check materials from ﬁeld trips in 2001 and 2003, applicative marked verbs were systematically rejected as being ‘unacceptable’ Bardi. This applied not only to sentences I had made up, but also to sentences which I had recorded on earlier trips and replayed.
§12.1 provides evidence for an argument/adjunct distinction in Bardi. §12.2 discusses valency in Bardi roots, and classiﬁes simple predicates by transitivity types. §12.3 contains a discussion of the different ways of marking reﬂexive and reciprocal forms in Bardi, while §12.4 gives details of the syntax and functions of the several applicatives.

460 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity

1. Argumenthood

As noted elsewhere, the distinction between arguments and adjuncts is difﬁcult to establish in Bardi. Traditional tests (see, e.g. Carnie 2002) rely mostly on omissibility; that is, adjuncts are optional, and can always be omitted from a clause, while arguments must be present. However, because Bardi has free noun phrase omission, this test fails. This is shown in (12.1), where any nonverbal constituent of the clause may be omitted without loss of grammaticality.

‘He/she saw the man.’

f. I-n-jala-gal. 3-TR-see-REC.PST

‘He/she saw him/her.’

Argumenthood 461
A second test for some types of arguments involves movement. In English, for example, objects usually appear immediately after their verbs; thus ‘pandas eat bamboo’ is grammatical, but ‘*pandas bamboo eat’ is not. This test fails in Bardi too, as word order is pragmatically determined, with the focus constituent in initial position and non-omitted topics in ﬁnal position. See further §15.1.2 for further discussion.
A third test for argument status is agreement. This is a better test for Bardi. Subjects and objects receive agreement marking on the verb. Copious examples are found in the grammar, particularly in Chapter 10 and §10.1, and so are not repeated here. It should be noted, however, that agreement is not an entirely straightforward diagnostic of agreement, since a) some agreement is optional; b) some items which are clearly not arguments (e.g. possessors of subjects or objects) may receive agreement marking on the verb; and c) some verbs are impersonal, and show invariant agreement.
Given that the only area where arguments can be fairly clearly distinguished is in agreement, it is tempting to argue that the ‘agreement’ markers on the verb are themselves the arguments of the verb, and the free nominals are coreferential, anaphoric adjuncts. This assumption is known as the Pronominal Argument Hypothesis, see Austin and Bresnan (1996), Baker (2000), Hale (1983, 1989), Jelinek (1984) for discussion, amongst others. Bardi agreement marking does show many of the properties of arguments. It is mostly obligatory and it behaves as expected with respect to reﬂexive/reciprocal marking, for example. However, there are also reasons to believe that agreement marking does not satisfy the argument properties of the verb alone. For example, there are contexts under which free noun phrases appear not to be omissible (see §7.1.5 for some potential examples). Gerunds (§11.3) take no agreement marking, but nonetheless allow for the appearance of subjects marked with ergative case. This is not expected if the free noun phrase is simply anaphorically related to the agreement marker. Finally, there are two other areas where free noun phrases appear sensitive to a distinction between arguments and adjuncts. The ﬁrst is in double interrogative marking; see §15.4.3 for the data. The second is that it appears that possessives within arguments (subject and object) can be marked on the verb, but possessives within adjuncts cannot. These ﬁndings are unexpected if all free noun phrases are adjunct-like.
Thus in summary, there is evidence for a distinction between adjunct and argument noun phrases, though it is slight. Other evidence may come from speaker intuitions about arguments which are omitted and understood from

462 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity
context, versus cases where there are no arguments (that is, distinctions between sentences like ‘he’s eating [cake]’ and ‘*we put the table’).
2. Inﬂecting root valency
Bardi’s approximately 300 inﬂecting verb roots form a closed class.161 There are no productive modern derivational patterns and no ways of forming new roots in the grammar. Loan verbs, for example, are borrowed as uninﬂecting preverbs and assigned an appropriate light verb (see Chapter 13).
Following previous descriptions of Nyulnyulan languages (for example, Hosokawa 1991, McGregor 1994b, Stokes 1982a) I recognize three classes of verb roots on the basis of root valency: monovalent, bivalent, and ambitransitive. The class of verb root affects the form of the imperative preﬁx and the presence or absence of the valency preﬁx n- ∼ a-.162 Nyulnyulan roots have been historically described in terms of ‘transitivity’ (that is, intransitive, transitive or ambitransitive); however, I wish to draw a distinction (following Van Valin and LaPolla 1997:147 ff., Margetts 1999 and others) between root valency and predicate/clausal transitivity. Valency is a lexical property and refers to the number of arguments which appear with a particular verb. Transitivity is a property of the clause and refers to the interaction between argument structure, case marking and agreement. This distinction is necessary in Bardi for two reasons, ﬁrst because the number of arguments that a verb may take does not entirely determine case marking and agreement forms, and second because there are differences between simple and complex predicates, where the valency of the inﬂecting root is different from the transitivity of the predicate.
As might be gleaned from this description, the identiﬁcation of valency types in Bardi is not entirely straightforward. While there are general tendencies which adequately describe most of the verbs in the corpus, there are also some exceptions; for example, monovalent roots can be adequately deﬁned by their ability to take a single argument which is marked in absolutive case and cross-referenced by subject preﬁxal agreement, but the small class of impersonal verbs also have a subject marker (though it is obligatorily third person, and so does not behave in the same way as the monovalent agreement markers).
Of the verbs in the Bardi lexicon for which precise information on transitivity is available, 16 are semi-transitive (taking object objects and ergative

Inﬂecting root valency 463
case-marked subjects), 186 are bivalent, 86 are monovalent, and 21 are ambitransitive. 16 roots are listed as taking reﬂexive/reciprocal marking with a change in meaning, but these roots are also found without reﬂexive/reciprocal marking.
McGregor (2002) argues that Nyulnyulan languages also have ‘avalent’ roots, that is, roots that do not have an inherent valency but can take either one or two arguments, according to necessity. The category is different from the ambitransitive roots; the members of the supposed avalent class are light verbs which are sometimes transitive and sometimes intransitive (see further §13.8 for examples and discussion). In McGregor’s framework, verbs such as -joo- ‘do, say’ are not underlyingly speciﬁed for argument structure (which McGregor argues is determined by the preverb). The inﬂecting verb is simply a host for morphology. I treat these roots as inherently bivalent and have a different solution for dealing with apparently intransitive complex predicates, which are the source of McGregor’s need for the category. Thus I do not recognize a class of avalent roots in Nyulnyulan languages.

2.1. Monovalent roots

2.1.1. The regular pattern

Monovalent roots are those which take a single (subject) argument, which receives absolutive case. They show subject agreement and cannot take Direct Object agreement clitics. They can also appear with the ‘intransitive’ imperative nga-. Furthermore, these verbs cannot appear with the transitivity preﬁx n-. Some examples of regular monovalent roots are given in (12.2) below.

(12.2)

a. Imboonkoonkoomana jiirlanboo. I-m-boonkoonkooma-na jiirlanboo. 3-PST-swell.up-REM.PST porcupine.ﬁsh
‘The porcupine ﬁsh swelled up.’ b. Nganyjiidigal arangan booroo.

I-ng-arr-jalg-ij

gaalw-o.

3-PST-AUG-fall-MID.PFV raft-ABL

‘They fell off the raft.’

2.1.2. Exceptionally case-marked arguments

There are a few exceptions to the regular pattern of monovalent verbs. Some verb roots are formally intransitive (that is, they take no n- preﬁx) but nonetheless can appear with two arguments, both of which appear in absolutive case. The root -golo- ‘wear’, for example, can take an absolutive object referring to the thing being worn. -banji- ‘share’ is another root that can appear with this frame. These are illustrated in (12.3) (which shows an overt direct object NP) and (12.4), which has two full NPs for subject and object.

(12.3) Bardi ngonggolij jiiba anmarr. Bardi ngo-ng-gol-ij jiiba anmarr. yesterday 1-PST-wear PFV those clothes.
‘I wore these clothes yesterday.’ (12.4) Milon ambooriny ingarrbanjanjinan aarlimay.

‘In the old days people used to share food.’

Another small set of verb roots take oblique object agreement. In (12.5), for example, the verb shows oblique agreement for third person minimal =jin; a third person direct object would not be overtly marked in the verb.

(12.5) Imbalanin. I-m-bala-n=in. 3-PST-believe-REM.PST=3MIN.IO
‘He believed him.’

(Metcalfe 1975a:-bala-)

Inﬂecting root valency 465

Another example is the verb manggarra ‘be ignored’, where the person being ignored is the subject and the ignorers are marked with oblique marking:

(12.6) Ngangamanggarrananajirr.
Nga-nga-manggarra-na-na=jirr. 1-PST-be.ignored-CONT-REM.PST=3A.IO

‘I was continually ignored by them.’

(Metcalfe 1975a)

Finally, among the monovalent verbs which take oblique agreement, ﬁve inﬂecting verbs also appear with an ergative subject. In (12.7), for example, there are two arguments—baawa ‘child’, which shows ergative marking, and ngaarri ‘devil’, in the absolutive—even though the verb is ‘monovalent’ in that it does not show the transitive preﬁx n-/a-. (12.7b) shows that the ergative differentiates subject from oblique; it is not omissible even when the semantic roles are clear from context.

(12.7)

a. Baawanim inyjargijin ngaarri.

Baawa-nim i-ny-jargi=jin

ngaarri-ø.

child-ERG 3-PST-fear=3MIN.IO devil-ABS

b. Inyjargijin ngaarri.

I-ny-jargi=jin

ngaarri-ø.

3-PST-fear=3MIN.IO devil-ABS

‘He was afraid of the devil.’ *‘The devil was afraid of him.’

Verbs with this frame, like -jargi- ‘fear’, typically have an experiencer subject (or other subject which is not highly agentive). A few other verbs in Bardi also take this pattern or ergative/oblique case marking with a formally monovalent verb. They are listed in (12.8) below. There are possibly significantly more verbs which take this pattern, but are not attested with overt subjects, so it cannot be determined whether they take absolutive or ergative subjects. Also listed here are complex predicates with identical argument frames. Other Nyulnyulan languages also have simplex verbs which take this pattern, although the inventory of the class varies from language to language.

466 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity

(12.8)

-jargi-lirrmi-mi-midoordoo-joorrgoojiin -armarndal -nyayalji -ma-

‘fear’ ‘call out to someone’ ‘look for someone’ ‘turn around and look at’ ‘run away from’ ‘point out something’ ‘take aim at’ ‘crave something’

A few examples of these verbs are given in (12.9) below:

(12.9) (12.10)

a. Niimananim ambooriny ingilirrminjin. Niimana-nim ambooriny i-ngi-lirrmi-n=jin. many-ERG person 3-PST-call.out-CONT=3M.IO

‘A lot of people called out for him.’

b. Iindoonim ingilirrmigaljard. Iindoo-nim i-ngi-lirrmi-gal=jard. curlew-ERG 3-PST-call.out-REC.PST=1A.IO

booroo.

there

point.out 1-TR-pierce=3MIN.IO place

‘I pointed out a place.’

(LPB.003)

It is possible that this type of verbal marking should be equated with the unexpected ergative subjects of intransitive verbs described in §5.3.1.2.2 above. In that construction, normally intransitive verbs receive subjects in the ergative case if the subject is particularly unusual. While the construction is not productive in modern Bardi, it is found in other Nyulnyulan languages and is more productive there. Perhaps this case frame was generalized for some verbs from exceptionally case-marked subjects.

2.1.3. Impersonal verbs
Bardi has a few impersonal verbs; that is, verbs which neither take personal agreement nor coreference arguments. They are all complex predicates (see Chapter 13).

Inﬂecting root valency 467

(12.11)

3-TR-catch-REM.PST still little

‘It was still catching ﬁre a little underneath.’

(M.Dict)

Example (12.11a) has the derived preverb o˙ola ‘water’; that word is not the subject of the verb, however, because it cannot appear in any position other than the immediately preverbal one, including in the case of negation, where the negative marker occurs before the word. Thus oola behaves as a regular preverb, and not as a subject noun phrase, in such constructions.
These verbs have an unchanging third person minimal agreement preﬁx i-. There is an additional verb in Metcalfe (1975a) which appears to be impersonal, but the preverb takes inalienable possessive marking which corresponds to the person who is forbidden to do something.163

‘I mustn’t do it.’

(M.Dict)

468 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity
Four other complex predicates take no personal subjects, but may take personal objects. The most common is rarrjin+ ‘be ashamed of’, which has impersonal (third person minimal) subject agreement, and person direct object marking, as in (12.13).
(12.13) Rarrjin inmanjarrngay. Rarrjin i-n-ma-n=jarrngay. shame 3-TR-put-CONT=1M.DO
‘I’m ashamed of it.’

2.2. Bivalent roots

2.2.1. The regular pattern

Bivalent roots regularly agree for two arguments, the subject and the (direct) object. They take the ‘transitive’ imperative a- rather than the intransitive nga-. The usual case marking pattern is ergative subject and absolutive object. Some examples are given below. In (12.14) the subject is aalin ‘sea eagle(s)’, marked for ergative case; subject agreement is shown by i- for third person and rr- for an augmented (non-singular) subject. Maalbarnd ‘nest(s)’ is the object; generic third person objects are not overtly marked in the verb.

An example showing overt object agreement is given below. The form of the ﬁrst person singular object marker is =jarrngay.

‘This man asked me for money.’

2.2.2. Exceptions

Some bivalent verbs take ergative subject marking and oblique object marking. The root -marniny- ‘wave at’, for example, takes the preﬁx n- ∼ a- (and is bivalent), but takes ergative subject marking and oblique object marking, as shown in (12.17).

(12.17) Ingarramarninyjin boonyjanim baawa gala arr injin joodinygo.

3-TR-say/do-CONT for.good

‘All the kids waved at him, he was going away for good.’ (Aklif 1999:-marniny-)

Just as in the case of monovalent roots, a few bivalent roots also show a mismatch between expected valency on the basis of the root morphology and actual surface number of arguments. Some verbs can take several argument structures but do not belong to the morphological class of ambitransitive verbs. The only securely attested verb of this type is -gala- ‘visit, follow, walk around’, which can be monovalent or bivalent, but always takes the preﬁx marker n- ∼ a-. In (12.19), for example, the verb is irralj, showing transitive morphology. If it were intransitive the form would be irrgalj.

spirit-ABS scrub-NULL.LOC 3-AUG-stay-SIMUL.

‘Layoord spirits live in the scrub.’

2.2.3. Trivalent roots
Roots which in some languages are trivalent (or ditransitive), such as English ‘show’, ‘tell’ and ‘give’, are probably bivalent in Bardi, although it is difﬁcult to tell for certain. No verb in Bardi obligatorily takes more than two agreement markers (though remember that up to three markers can appear if one is marking an adjunct).
The phonologically null root ‘give’ (-ø-) agrees for two arguments; the agent (‘giver’) and the recipient, which is encoded as a direct object. For example, the form of ‘give it to me’ is ana=ngay with DO marking for ﬁrst person, not *ana=jan or *ana=jan=irr (with oblique marking, or both DO and IO marking). The most plausible analysis is to treat -ø- as bivalent and to analyze the theme as an adjunct, the same analysis (mutatis mutandis) as for -golo- ‘wear’ in §12.2.1.2 above, which would also have a theme as adjunct. Another potential trivalent verb, -jilngi- ∼ -joolngoo- ‘tell’, shows exceptional case marking in that it takes an ergative subject and oblique agreement (but no direct object), like -marnany- ‘wave’ above.
It is difﬁcult to test for adjunct or argument status in the absence of agreement, since arguments may be freely omitted without deterioration of grammaticality. In some Australian languages we have the evidence of implicatures when there is a null argument; in Warlpiri (Austin and Bresnan 1996), for example, third persons are obligatorily deﬁnite, even when not crossreferenced on the agreement clitic complex. This is not the case in Bardi, however, where null arguments are not obligatorily deﬁnite. Indeﬁnite third person plural objects, for example, receive null agreement, as discussed in

Inﬂecting root valency 471
§5.1.1. It seems most parismonious to asusme that Bardi does not have any trivalent roots, since the agreement patterns found with them can be subsumed under known patterns for bivalent roots.

2.3. Ambitransitive/alternative preﬁxing roots

Most roots in Nyulnyulan languages take either transitive or intransitive agreement preﬁx bundles, but not both. That is, they appear either with or without the valency marker n- ∼ a- in all contexts. However, all the Nyulnyulan languages have a set of about twenty verb roots which can take either transitive or intransitive subject preﬁxes. They are called ‘alternative preﬁxing’ or ‘ambitransitive’ verbs in the other grammars of Nyulnyulan languages (e.g. Hosokawa 1991, Stokes 1982a, and in some detail Stokes 1985). Roots which show valency alternations without overt derivation are seldom found in Australian languages; Dixon (2002:176), for example, states that they do not exist, and argues that every root in every Australian language is strictly transitive or intransitive. Valency alternations, he states, are accomplished only by overt derivation. Bardi is a counterexample in that there is no overt derivational marking of ambitransitive verbs; we cannot call the transitivity marker ‘derivational,’ since in most cases it does not derive bivalent roots from monovalent ones; it is either obligatorily present or absent, like a conjugation marker.
The examples in (12.20) and (12.21) below show two ambitransitive roots, -gama- ‘laugh/mock’ and -banyi- ‘ﬁnish/kill’. In (12.20), the root in sentence (a) is monovalent and appears in the meaning ‘laugh’, while in (b) it is bivalent, showing the preﬁx n-. (The agreement marker =(ji)rri is not repeated from the ﬁrst part of the clause in example (b), but co-reference is understood from the simultaneity marker -j.)

In (12.21) the bivalent verb means to ‘ﬁnish’ or ‘kill’ something, while the monovalent root is the unaccusative counterpart, ‘ﬁnish’ or by metaphorical extension ‘die’.164 (12.21b) shows the bivalent pattern, with ergative subject (liinyja ‘policemen’), augmented transitive preﬁx a-, and direct object agreement =(i)rr. (12.21a) is monovalent.

Table 12.1 gives the alternative preﬁxing verbs which occur in Bardi. There is a good deal of overlap between the class of Bardi ambitransitives and English ‘middle’ verbs (those which have two readings, one transitive one intransitive unaccusative).165 As can be seen from Table 12.1, there are several sets of argument structure alternations in the ambitransitive verbs. One is where the the object of the bivalent verb is the sole argument of the monovalent verb. The majority of ambitransive verbs show this pattern.
One verb, -gama- ‘laugh/mock’, is subject-preserving; that is, the subject of the monovalent verb is the same as the subject of the bivalent verb.166 Finally, a few verbs show tenuous semantic links between the monovalent and bivalent roots.

3. Reﬂexives and reciprocals
Bardi has a true morphological reﬂexive/reciprocal construction, which is a circumﬁx to the verb root and which interacts with the other morphology; this is discussed in §12.3.2. There are also lexical means by which speakers realize concepts of reciprocity, which are discussed below.
In some Australian languages, the reﬂexive/reciprocal marking does more than alter the valency of the inﬂected verb. It can be used to signal aspectual differences, and to denote inclusivity of the action of the verb beyond strict grammatical reﬂexivity or reciprocity (see Evans 2008 and Levinson et al. 2011 for more information). The reciprocal in these languages can be also used in these non-valency-changing functions on intransitive verbs. This is not the case in Bardi. The reﬂexive/reciprocal is quite strictly a valencechanging process.
Data for this section come from the corpus, but also from discussion of the MPI 2004 ﬁeld manual stimulus materials for reciprocals, which I played to Bessie Ejai in 2008. Discussion of the video prompts took place in both Bardi and English, with extensive codeswitching in some places. The same forms are used both for morphological reﬂexive and reciprocal marking. My impression is that reciprocal interpretations are more common than reﬂexives but I have no direct data to conﬁrm this impression, since so much of the data on this topic is elicited.
3.1. Lexical realizations
Before the morphological realizations of reﬂexive/reciprocal marking are discussed, it is worth detailing a few of the lexical ways in which concepts of reciprocation can be expressed by lexical items and in ways other than morphological afﬁxation on the verb. There are three ways in which this is done. There are adverbs of reciprocation; there are also emphatic pronouns such as niimalgoyarr and niimalgang. Finally, there are some inherently reﬂexive/reciprocal verb roots.
3.1.1. Adverbs of reciprocation: rooban and anyjimadan
Adverbs of reciprocation are listed in §16.98b where there is more general discussion of adverbs. There are a few examples where rooban ‘in return’ or

Reﬂexives and reciprocals 475

anyjimadan ‘back’ are used to paraphrase reciprocal marking. Examples are given below.

(12.22) Jiiba langanalangana, injiidingjin langan [then] arnim injiidingjin langan rooban.

Jiiba langana-langana, i-n-jiidi-ng=jin

‘This other man threw it to the other man, and they threw the book

back to the woman.’

(BA-CB56.1)

The adverb amboon ‘together’ can be used when reduplicated to imply an action that is done reciprocally.

(12.24) Amboonamboon roowil ingirrinyinj.
Amboon-amboon roowil i-ng-irr-i-nyi-n-j. together-REDUP walk 3-PST-AUG-TR-catch-CONT-SIMUL

‘They walked with each other.’

(BOW-FN.11/28)

3.1.2. Niimalgoyarr and overt pronouns
There are two items which appear to behave somewhat like reﬂexive pronouns. They take agreement preﬁx marking (and so are technically nouns in terms of word class); they translate as ‘self’ and were brieﬂy discussed in §7.3

476 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity

on emphatic pronouns (and pronominal items) above. Not all emphatic pronouns can be used in reﬂexive/reciprocal contexts, however. The most common item in my corpus is niimalgoyarr, but nimalga is found in the Laves corpus with the same function, and Metcalfe gives a form nimarlgang. Some examples are given below. Note that the pronouns can also combine with the morphological verbal reﬂexive marking in examples such as (12.25b).

(12.25)

a. Baawanim arra oolarrarlirr jarri aarli irrmalgoyarr.

Baawa-nim arra oo-l-arr-arl=irr

b. Bardag ingoomoogoolinyjigal nimolgoyarr.

Bardag i-ngoo-m-oogool-inyji-gal

Nimalgijina abarrabarr oorany.

self

fault

woman

‘It was her own fault.’

(L93.015)

There is also a form nimalgijina (see (12.26)) in the Laves materials, which was unknown to current speakers but could be analyzed either as nimalga=jina ‘self=3M.POSS’ or perhaps as nimal-gij-jina ‘self=VERY=3MIN’; the former is more likely.
As illustrated in (12.25a), these markers take the possessive preﬁx marking described above in §7.5 above. Laves’ form, nimalga, also shows this behavior:

(12.27) “Nyimalga garnd anama,” ingirrin.
“Nyi-malga garnd a-na-m-a,” 2M-self above 2TR.IMP-TR-put-FUT i-ng-irr-i-n. 3-PST-AUG-do/say-CONT

‘“Put her up yourself (in a tree cofﬁn),” they said.’

Reﬂexives and reciprocals 477

The reﬂexive/reciprocal pronouns pick out the agent as a member of a set of potential participants, and imply that they are the sole person doing the action (e.g that X did something him/herself and did not wait for others to do it). For example, in (12.28), the implication of the use of irrmolgoyarr is that the ﬁsh are not dying through the use of ﬁsh poison, but just of their own accord.

(12.28) Irralb mool injoonana jard aalga, gaarra moola biila, aarligid ingirrjimbinan irrmolgoyarr.

Irralb mool i-n-joo-na-na

jard aalga,

hot.season hot 3-TR-do/say-CONT-REM.PST 1AUG day

gaarra moola biila, aarli=gid i-ng-irr-jimbi-na-n

sea.water hot too ﬁsh=THUS 3-PST-AUG-die-CONT-REM.PST

irr-molgoyarr.

3AUG-self

‘In the irralb season the sun got hot and the sea got very hot and ﬁsh were dying by themselves, of their own accord.’ (MLB.002)

Unlike the morphological marking of reﬂexivity, these pronouns do not make a verb intransitive. They can also be used with intransitive verbs, as in (12.28). Furthermore, niimalgoyarr does not have the binding properties of true reﬂexive pronouns, as examples such as (12.29) show.

(12.29) Niimalgoyarr jina abarr.

Nii-malgoyarr jina abarr.

3-self

3M.POSS fault

‘It was his own fault.’ (Lit: ‘[It was] himself his fault, it was him-

self’s fault.’)

(conversation, 2008)

In this case, niimalgoyarr ‘his own’ is binding (that is, creating a coreference context for) the possessive pronoun jina. We would not expect this sentence to be grammatical if niimalgoyarr were a true reﬂexive pronoun. Reﬂexive pronouns, by deﬁnition, receive their interpretation from (that is, are ‘bound’ by) another item in the clause. Crosslinguistically, reﬂexive pronouns may appear as direct objects, where they are interpreted as coreferential with the subject; however, the opposite conﬁguration does not obtain. In English, for example, ‘Maryi sees herselfi’ is grammatical, but ‘*Herselfi sees Maryi’ is

478 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity
not. In (12.29), there is no item for the pronoun niimalgoyarr to receive interpretation from (and note that the literal English translation is ungrammatical with a reﬂexive pronoun). This implies that niimalgoyarr is not a true reﬂexive pronoun.

3.1.3. Verbs with inherently reciprocal meanings

A few verbs are formally intransitive but with plural subjects contain an inherent meaning of reciprocity. For example, in (12.30) the verb -nganka- ‘talk’ is interpreted as inherently involving participants who are participating in a reciprocal action. In such cases, the morphological reciprocal is ungrammatical.

(12.30)

a. Irrngankanjamb. i-rr-nganka-n=jamb 3-AUG-talk-CONT=THUS
‘They’re [just] talking to each other.’ b. * Irrngankinyji c. * Irramankinyji
(Intended: ‘they were talking to each other.’)

3.2. Morphological marking: m(a)- -inyji

The primary reﬂexive/reciprocal marker in Bardi is a verbal circumﬁx of the form m(a)- -inyj(i). The morphemes are immediately adjacent to the verb root in simplex verbs. Verbs marked for the reﬂexive/reciprocal are formally intransitive—they take the intransitive second person imperative nga- and there is no transitivity marker n- ∼ a-.

The reciprocal meaning can be paraphrased as ‘X did something, and then Y did the same thing,’ as in (12.33a) (repeated from (12.22) above); the reciprocal sentence is in (12.33b):

(12.33)

(CB56.1)

The preﬁx component m- interacts phonologically with the initial consonant of the root. Initial obstruents are deleted, while epenthesis occurs between m- and initial sonorants. Thus the reﬂexive stem of the root -jala- ‘see, look at’ is -m-al-inyji- (< *ma-jala-inyji-) (see, for example, (12.34b)), while the reﬂexive form of -marra- ‘cook, burn’ is -ma-marr-inyji-. Some examples are given in (12.34). As seen from these examples, the sufﬁxal portion of the reﬂexive/reciprocal marker is vowel-initial, and that vowel deletes the ﬁnal vowel of the verb root.

Nekes and Worms (1953:150) describe the reﬂexive/reciprocal as ma/me- and -djen for all Nyulnyulan languages. They have misanalyzed forms such as ma-madjalen-djen ‘to look at each other’ (Jabirr-Jabirr) (the form is quoted with their morpheme boundaries); they place the reﬂexive sufﬁx portion following the tense marker. The correct morpheme division is ma-ma-jala-nyji-n GER-REFL1-see-REFL2-CONT. Perhaps Nekes and Worms were confused by the use of the third minimal oblique =jin as reﬂexive with the verb -joo- ‘do/say’ (for this see further §12.3.7 below).
Many verbs are ambiguous between reﬂexive and reciprocal interpretations when plural. When the subject is minimal, of course, there is no ambiguity, as interpretation can only be reﬂexive. Though I do not have systematic data on this point, it appears that some verbs allow only the reciprocal reading, and are not compatible with reﬂexives. An example of this is given in (12.36). The cause of the unacceptibility of (12.36) is probably semantics.

3.3. Sufﬁxal reﬂexive marking

In all the well-attested Nyulnyulan languages, the reﬂexive sufﬁx can appear without the preﬁxal component. Some examples for Bardi are given in (12.37), and for Nyikina (in comparison) in (12.38):

Hosokawa (1991:§4.8.3) argues for Yawuru that sufﬁx-only examples are obligatorily analyzed as reciprocals, and do not admit the reﬂexive interpretation. He points to pairs such as those illustrated in (12.39) below. In (12.39a), only the reciprocal reading is allowed, while (12.39b) is ambiguous between reﬂexive and reciprocal interpretations.

(Hosokawa 1991:§4.6.6.1)

My data for Bardi conﬁrm this interpretation to a certain extent, although the judgments are not entirely clear. In (12.37c) above, for example, the translation given was reﬂexive, not reciprocal167 but the reduplication of the root also implies pluractionality. In this example it is clearly not the case that each whale is splashing itself, taking care not to get any water on its companions. The action is not directed reciprocally either, however, for the whales are presumably not deliberately having a water ﬁght. Further research is required in this area.
Bardi also has a few pairs of verbs that differ only in the presence or absence of the initial or ﬁnal component of the reﬂexive. These are lexical pairs; that is, these verbs exhibit frozen reﬂexive/reciprocal afﬁxation. In the case of (12.40b), Metcalfe (1975b:96) has this verb marked as obligatorily sufﬁxed, and records an example ingimilbirinyjij ‘it echoed’, although I have only ingimilbirigal, with no reﬂexive/reciprocal sufﬁxation.

(12.40) (12.41)

a. -jilbira- ‘sing’ b. -milbira- ‘echo’ a. Imandandina. ‘He’s scratching himself.’ (root: -mandanda-) b. Imandandinyjin. ‘He’s scratching himself.’

In the case of (12.40) it is likely that the form with the reﬂexive preﬁxal component m- is fossilized, since -milbira- is not felt by speakers to be derived from -jilbira-.

Reﬂexives and reciprocals 483

3.4. Reﬂexive of -joo- ‘do/say’

Many complex predicates can be made reﬂexive/reciprocal by using the reﬂexive/reciprocal of the verb -joo- ‘do/say’, whatever the light verb of the non-reﬂexive complex predicate. The form is underlyingly m-joo-inyji, and due to deletion rules it surfaces as -minyji-. Examples of this construction were mostly collected from a single speaker in 2008, and did not occur in previous ﬁeld trips. Therefore I am unable to judge how productive this might have been in the earlier language. These verbs admit both reﬂexive and reciprocal readings, and some, like (12.43), are idiomatic.

(12.42) reﬂexives of bany inamagal ‘he shot (something)’ a. bany i-m-banji-gal shoot 3-PST-share-REC.PST b. bany i-ngi-m-i-nyji-gal shoot 3-PST-REFL-do/say-REFL-REC.PST ‘He shot himself.’ c. *bany i-nga-ma-m-inyji-gal shoot 3-PST-REFL-put-REFL-REC.PST

a. anganangan i-ng-irr-m-i-nyji-gal approach 3-PST-AUG-REFL-do/say-REFL-REC.PST
‘She bumped into her aloorr (taboo relative).’

In some cases, the verb will admit reﬂexivization with the reﬂexive of -joo- ‘do/say’ but not with -banji- ‘share’. In other cases, such as (12.42) above, both are possible. It is not known what governs the difference.

3.5. Monovalent roots and reﬂexive marking

Some monovalent stems in Nyulnyulan languages can take reﬂexive/reciprocal derivations, especially in conjunction with applicative morphemes. A example sentence from Nyikina is given in (12.45):

(12.45) Nyikina
Yi-ma-bula-nydyi-na-ngany yibirirr . . . inydya 3-REFL1-come-REFL2-PST-APPL king.brown going yin-ba-na. 3-TR-see-PAST

‘He came across a King Brown snake (Pseudechis australis) . . . he

saw it moving.’

(Stokes 1982a:288)

Stokes (1982a:287ff) describes this use of the reﬂexive as denoting ‘selfcontained’ events; that is, actions that only signiﬁcantly involve action between the subject and object. The only data I have on equivalent uses of the reﬂexive/reciprocal with monovalent roots in Bardi are the two forms given in (12.46) to (12.48) below.

(12.46) Lol ingirrmiidinyjigal.

Lol i-ng-irr-m-iid-inyji-gal. burn 3-PST-AUG-REFL1-go-REFL2-REC.PST

‘They set each other on ﬁre.’

(12.47) Joodarrarr ingarrmalalinyjigal.

Joodarrarr i-ng-arr-m-alal-inyji-gal. go.with.the.tide 3-PST-AUG-REFL1wander-REFL2-REC.PST

‘They went with each other, ﬂoating along with the tide.’ (BOW-FN.12/26)

Although the complex predicate in (12.47) is intransitive, and takes a single subject argument, the light verb it is derived from, -galala- ‘follow’, is bivalent. Thus this is not an unambiguous example of intransitive reﬂexive/reciprocal marking in Bardi. The example in (12.46) is from a monovalent light verb (and an intransitive complex predicate), but it is not unambiguously grammatical. One speaker accepted it, but another did not.
There is one further example:

Reﬂexives and reciprocals 485

(12.48) Darr ingarrmarinyjigal. Darr i-ng-arr-m-ar-inyji-gal. come 3-PST-AUG-REFL1-spear-REFL2-PAST
‘They met each other.’

(L51a.003)

This is the reﬂexive/reciprocal of the complex predicate darr+ -ar- ‘come’, which is intransitive, although the light verb root itself is bivalent (see further §13.8). However, although this form does indicate that reﬂexive/reciprocal marking may be compatible with intransitive predicates in some circumstances, it is very unclear whether the construction is equivalent to the one described by Stokes for Nyikina. There are too few examples to tell whether there is any notion of ‘containment’ in the actions denoted by the verbs (and how this would differ from other examples of reciprocal marking).

3.6. -banji- ‘share’

Reﬂexive/reciprocal morphology on an inﬂecting verb is generally used only in simple predicates. In complex predicates, the light verb -banji- ‘share’ provides the reﬂexive or reciprocal meaning. This is also found in other Nyulnyulan languages (an example is given from Nyikina in (12.49)168).

(12.49) Nyikina Dyub ngam-barnji-ny. cut 1(IT)-share-PST
‘I cut myself.’

(Stokes 1982a:291)

Examples (12.50) and (12.51) illustrate equivalent forms in Bardi. The ﬁrst member of the pair is the regular verb, while the second form is the reﬂexive. In (12.51), we see an example with both the reﬂexive verb -banji‘share’ and the reﬂexive preﬁx m-.

b. loorrbloorrb ingarrbanjij ‘they were arguing with each other’ c. loorrbloorrb ingorrmonjij ‘they were arguing with each other’

While marking with -banji- is the most common way to form reﬂexive/ reciprocal complex predicates, some complex predicates do admit morphological reﬂexive/reciprocal marking. A few examples are given below. In (12.52) the complex predicate barn -joo- is reﬂexivized with reﬂexive/reciprocal marking on the verb. In (12.53) the reﬂexive/reciprocal preﬁx is used on the verb -banji-.

3.7. Indirect reﬂexives: =jin ‘3M.IO’
The third person oblique clitic =jin can be used with a reﬂexive meaning. Examples are most common with -joo- ‘say’ and complex predicate derivatives which are also speech verbs (such as barn -joo- ‘think, tell oneself something’).

Reﬂexives and reciprocals 487

(CT/26)

As shown by (12.54), =jin does not have to agree in person and number with its antecedent when used in this way. If it were agreeing with the subject, the verb form would be angirrijarda instead.
There are a few examples where =jin is used to mark reﬂexives of verbs which have dative objects. An example is given in (12.55). Note that the valency of this verb is not altered here, as the subject, mayala ‘goanna’, takes ergative case marking.

488 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity

4. Applicatives

The other valency-changing process in Nyulnyulan languages is applicative marking. Its basic function is to promote an oblique argument or an adjunct to the direct object position. In Bardi, the argument status of applied items is a little unclear, since although they may receive agreement marking on the verb, they do not have to lose their instrumental case marking. Moreover, though one case of applicatives alters transitivity marking on the verb, the most common applicative (applicative2, discussed in §12.4.2) does not.
The form of the applicative marker is -ng or -nga. There is a further (possibly compound) sufﬁx -nginj, to be discussed further below. Some examples are given in (12.58) and (12.59).

(12.58) Roowil ingirrinyanang barda Iilonko barda Jawanan daab ingirrinyan jarri.

‘They walked off with [him] from Iilon and climbed up at Jawanan

(a hill on Sunday Island).’

(GAL1.059)

(12.59) “Bilamb anggoorroomoogara biil ara noorroo, anggoorrooloorroonginj noorroo.”

“Bilamb a-ngg-oorr-oo-moogar-a biil ara no˙orroo, AGAIN-LINK 1-FUT-AUG-TR-make-FUT again other ﬁre a-ngg-oorr-ooloorroo-nginj no˙orroo.” 1-FUT-AUG-TR-kindle-APPL ﬁre.

‘We’ll make another ﬁre and we’ll kindle another ﬁre with it.’ (BNY.010)

Bardi is unusual in having two positions in which the applicative marker can appear. This does not occur to my knowledge in other Nyulnyulan languages, although it is found cross-linguistically (O’Herin 2001, Polinsky 2005). The two applicatives exhibit different syntactic behavior, although the form of the morpheme is identical. The ﬁrst applicative transitivizes the verb (if it is underlyingly intransitive) and affects preﬁx morphology. Thus a verb

Applicatives 489
stem inﬂected with applicative1 usually takes transitive imperative marking. This does not happen when the verb takes applicative2 marking; in such cases, the verb preﬁxation remains intransitive. Some verbs can take both applicatives. Compare the difference in imperatives for the two applicatives of -jiidi‘go’. The verb in (a) shows the transitive imperative preﬁx, while the (b) verb shows the intransitive one.
(12.60) a. an-jiidi-ng! ‘touch it!’ (Applicative1) b. nga-yiidi-ng! ‘go with him!’ (Applicative2)
The second applicative has parallels in Abaza’s applicative construction (O’Herin 2001), which likewise does not alter the valency of the verb root. Applicative1 appears only with monovalent roots, and serves to transitivize them, while applicative2 may appear with either monovalent or bivalent roots.
The applicative1 sufﬁx often changes the meaning of the verb root. Neither applicative appears to be very productive, although this may be a feature of language loss. For example, speakers varied in which applicative verbs they would accept. Furthermore, grammaticality judgments were not consistent; speakers disagreed over which verbs were grammatical with the applicative2 and speakers’ own judgments changed over time. In a 2008 ﬁeld trip, no applicative constructions were judged grammatical and all sentences were replaced with circumlocutions.
I assume here that applicative1 affects the valency of the root (and is thus a derivational process), while applicative2 affects the transitivity of the predicate, but not the valency of the root. Since there are other areas of Bardi syntax where a distinction between root valency and clausal transitivity is useful, and since such a distinction has been proposed for other languages (see, for example, Margetts 1999), this seems to be the most parsimonious way to capture the differences in behavior between applicative1 and applicative2. It also allows us to explain why applicative2 triggers ergative case on the subject of the clause (if no alteration in the transitivity marker n- ∼ a- on the verb).
4.1. Applicative1 -ng
The ﬁrst (inner) applicative is attested with only a few roots. It occurs immediately adjacent to the verb root, before the reﬂexive/reciprocal sufﬁx. All attested roots are given with examples in (12.61):

490 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity
(12.61) a. i. inyjiidina ‘he went [somewhere]’ (root: -jiidi- ‘go’) ii. injiidingana ‘he touched it’ (stem: -jiidi-nga-)
b. i. inanggalana ‘he lived a long time ago’ (root: -gala- ‘visit, live’)
ii. inanggalangana ‘he helped him’ (stem: -gala-nga-) c. i. imbooloona ‘he came’ (root: -booloo- ‘come’)
ii. imboolongan ‘it came in (of tide); he came out at [a place]’ (stem: -booloo-ng-)
d. i. injooloona ‘he collected it’ (root: -jooloo- ‘collect’) ii. injooloongana ‘he collected it’ (stem: -jooloo-ng-)
e. i. injoona ‘he said it’ (root: -joo- ‘do/say’) ii. birarr injoongana ‘he left him behind’ (stem: -joo-ng-)
The semantics of the applicative1 sufﬁx are difﬁcult to describe. There are too few examples, with too many irregularities, to allow us to develop a cohesive description. Like other derivational marking in Bardi, it is rather irregular.
One point on which the use of applicative1 differs between verb roots is the argument structure. The applicative1 seems not to affect the valency of every root it attaches to. For example, -jooloo- and -jooloong- are described as semantically indistinguishable by Bardi speakers, and both verbs have the same argument structure (2 arguments, ERG and ABS case frame). Likewise, the monovalent -booloo- ‘come’ does not appear to increase its valency with the addition of the applicative1 in one meaning, although the derived root does have the additional meaning ‘come out at a place’, which is bivalent (and thus has been increased in valency).
4.2. Applicative2 -ng
The second applicative marker is much more common. This sufﬁx occurs towards the end of the sufﬁx chain, between the continuative sufﬁx and the recent past -gal.

Applicatives 491

4.2.1. Form

Applicative2-marked verbs show intransitive morphology. The applicative can, however, affect the case marking structure of the clause. For example, the complex predicate roowil -(i)nya- ‘walk’ normally takes a single argument in the absolutive. When combined with applicative2, however, the subject is ergative:

(12.62) Aarlimarr injoolana roowilgid innyanang gala layoordoonim.

4.2.2. Uses
4.2.2.1. Goal applicatives
There are three uses of this sufﬁx. The ﬁrst is to promote oblique-marked goals to direct objects. Compare (12.65) below, where the sentence in (a)

492 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity

shows oblique agreement, while the sentence in (b) shows the applicative and direct object agreement. In (12.66), the applicative acts as a transitivizer and turns the intransitive predicate ‘jump [on]’ into a predicate where the goal is marked.

(DRK.026)

4.2.2.2. Comitative applicatives

The second use of applicatives is their use in promoting an adjunct (in an accompaniment role) to direct object position. This is illustrated in (12.67), for example. In the (a) sentence, the adjunct birrii ‘mother’ is marked with the comitative case. In the equivalent (b) sentence, however, the verb is marked with the applicative -ng, the former adjunct is now marked in the absolutive, and the subject pronoun, ngayoo, is marked with ergative case. Further illustration from texts is given in (12.68) and (12.69).

(JMI.005)

The comitative applicative is by far the most common use of applicative2 in my corpus.
The examples above show comitatives with participants of equal animacy (that is, people walking together), or examples where someone is carrying something. There are, however, broader uses of the comitative applicative, such as with the verb -jala- ‘see’, when the comitative refers to the object rather than the subject. (12.70) is an interesting example for the fact that the direct object agreement is ﬁrst person rather than third person. That is, applicative agreement has not replaced the unapplied direct object in this example. See further §12.4.2.3 for discussion, and (12.71) for another example.

(JS: CB77/6)

4.2.2.3. Instrumental applicatives

Finally, applicatives can be used to promote an instrument from adjunct to object status:

(12.71) inoomoondoonanangjarrngayoo. i-noo-moondoo-na-na-ng=jarrngayoo. 3-TR-wet-CONT-PST-APPL2=1M.DO

(12.72)

‘He hit me with that very spear.’

4.2.3. Underlying direct objects
The examples in (12.70) and (12.71) raise an interesting property of Bardi applicatives, and applicative2 in particular. The presence of -ng and the promotion of the instrument to direct object does not appear to demote the underlying direct object obligatorily, although it may do (as in example (12.72) above). When the applicative is added to a transitive verb, the underlying object can remain, and be cross-referenced by agreement. A further example is given in (12.73). This sentence is ambiguous as to which object is the direct object and which is the applied object.169
(12.73) Injalangjarrngay. I-n-jala-ng=jarrngay. 3-TR-see-APPL=1M.DO
‘He saw me with it.’ ∼ ‘He saw it with me.’

Applicatives 495

The context of (12.73) was the situation in which the speaker had taken something from someone without asking permission in advance, but was subsequently spotted. This verb (and both translations) was given as a way to translate that situation into Bardi.
While (12.73) showed a form with direct object marking, (12.74) shows the alternative, with oblique agreement. As one can see from the example sentences in this section, both are found, and the difference between them is not currently known.

(12.74) Onondingjirr. O-n-ondi-ng=jirr. 2-TR-cover=3aug.IO

‘Cover them with it.’

(AKL/F1)

It is possible that some of the variation in applicative marking is due to language attrition. Some work was done with speakers in 2003, but when I tried to do further elicitation in 2008, none of the examples I had previously elicited or gathered from texts were accepted as grammatical. Speakers no longer used the construction, and so further investigation was impossible. Thus this discussion is reliant on textual examples from 2003 and earlier, and syntactic comments are based on the small amount of data I elicited with Nancy Isaac in 2003, which concentrated mostly on morphological and semantic aspects of applicative marking (such as the difference between applicative1 and applicative2), rather than syntactic ones.

4.2.4. Instrumental case marking

A further interesting property of instrumental applicatives (but not comitative applicatives) is that the instrument can surface with instrumental marking (that is, still marked as an adjunct), even though applicative marking appears on the verb. Two examples are given in (12.75). (12.75a) shows an example with instrumental marking and applicative marking, while (12.75b) shows an example with absolutive marking.

(AKL/F1)

‘Chuck the grease in the pool so we two will be able to see the ﬁsh in the pool.’

The applicative may also have an aspectual ﬂavor. For example, when Nancy Isaac was describing the difference between the verbs inambardigal and inambarndinggal, she said that the ﬁrst one would be used in the case of e.g. throwing sand over someone or something, while the second would be used if one is covering something up ‘for good’ (CB15). Jessie Sampi made similar comments on a different occasion.

4.2.5. Interaction with reﬂexive/reciprocal marking
The applicative (especially applicative2) may co-occur with reﬂexive/reciprocal marking. I have only a few examples; all are reﬂexive.170

4.3. Applicative3 -nginj

Finally, some comments are warranted on the form variously recorded as -nginj or -nginyj.171 It appears to be a variant of the regular applicative2, -nga. It is only used by one speaker consistently, and other speakers use it
sporadically. An example was given in (12.69) above. (12.80) gives a few
more examples:

There are several possible analyses for nginj/nginyj. Firstly, it could simply be a direct reﬂex of the Proto-Nyulnyulan comitative/instrumental, -ngany, plus the simultaneous action marker -j. Final *-ny is regularly lost in Western Nyulnyulan, but perhaps -ny was preserved in this context. This is rather

498 Argumenthood, Valency, and Transitivity

unlikely, however, as there are other contexts where *-ngany was not in ﬁnal position and the -ny was still lost (presumably through analogy). Also, we expect sequences of NVNO (that is, nasal-stop clusters preceded by a nasal) to be reduced to NVO through nasal dissimilation (thus we would expect *-ngij if nginj were a direct reﬂex of *ngany-j), and this points to an etymology with multiple morphemes.
The second possibility is that -nginj is the applicative2 -ng plus a variant of the simultaneous marker j. This solution will ﬁt semantically with almost all the examples. This solution is probably incorrect, however. Consider (12.81):

(12.81) Baybirr birarr nganjoonggalnginj.

Baybirr birarr

nga-n-joo-ng-gal-nginj.

behind leave.behind 1-TR-do/say-APPL1-REC.PST-NGINJ

‘I left him behind.’

The verb in (12.81) contains both the recent past -gal and -nginj, and -nginj appears after the tense marker (cf. (12.65))—recall that applicative1 and applicative2 both appear before the marker. However, it is possible that the applicative has three positions: APPL1 before the remote past -na, APPL2 before the recent past -gal, and APPL3 before the simultaneity sufﬁx -j.
Some elicited examples of -nginj are said by speakers to have identical marking to corresponding sentences with applicative2 marking.

Applicatives 499

b. Inamboonginj. I-na-m-boo-nginj. 3-TR-PST-hit-APPL-REC.PST

On the other hand, there is evidence that -nginj introduces a human comitative participant, and not an instrument, whereas APPL2 can do both. As seen from (12.84), the verb inamboonginj can only admit a comitative reading; the instrumental reading is ungrammatical.

The example in (12.85) would appear to refute this, however. Here the applicative is promoting dinggi, ‘dinghy’, which is not an accompanying noun.

On the other hand, there are other examples where the instrumental reading is ungrammatical:

In the absence of further information, I treat -nginj as an unanalyzable variant of the applicative2 -ng(a). We have no parallels for multiple positioning of the applicative sufﬁx in other Nyulnyulan languages and there are no parallels for the form -nginj in Western Nyulnyulan languages.

5. Quasi-passives

As brieﬂy described above in §5.3.1.2.3, Bardi has a construction whereby a causer acts on a patient; the causer receives ergative case marking, but the patient appears with subject cross-reference marking on the verb. The argument schema is set out in (12.88):

(12.88) ERGi ABS j j-verb

This construction is found in all Nyulnyulan languages (to my knowledge), and has been described in some detail for Yawuru in Hosokawa (1996). Hosokawa calls this a quasi-passive, and I follow his term here. While the basic syntax of the construction is identical in both languages, the usage patterns vary. The Yawuru construction is used particularly with body parts, but as can be seen from examples such as (12.89c), in Bardi the usage is wider. Typical examples for Bardi are given below.

(12.89)

a. Inkoorrnim alig ngandan. Inkoorr-nim alig nga-n-d-an. cold-ERG pain 1-TR-do/say-CONT

‘I feel cold.’

Boolyja nga-n-j-ij

moorrgooloo-nim.

black 3-[PST]-TR-do/say-REC.PST sand ﬁre-ERG

‘The ground got black from the ﬁre.’

(Aklif 1994b:4)

Just as Hosokawa (1996:166) states for Yawuru, in Bardi the quasi-passive construction only resembles passivization in that the patient argument appears to be promoted from direct object marking to subject marking. There

Quasi-passives 501
is no corresponding demotion of the ergative-marked NP. Moreover, the ergative-marked NP is not omitted from these constructions, even though both Yawuru and Bardi have few constraints on argument omission in general.172 As can be seen from (12.89c), the ergative-marked NP is peripheral; that is, while it may either precede or follow the verb, the patient is closer to the verb.
Quasi-passives are usually adversative; that is, they describe something that is negative to the patient, such as feeling sick, being burnt, or dying. The examples in §5.3.1.2.3 also conform to this generalization. The only example I have where the outcome is neutral rather than negative is (12.91), where a boy hides in the ashes of an old ﬁre to escape an evil spirit. Even in this example, however, the outcome might be perceived to be negative, because once he walks back to his camp, his family mistakes him for an evil spirit because of the ashiness of his skin.
(12.90) Inkoorrnim ngangimilijarrngay.
Inkoorr-nim nga-ngi-mili=jarrngay. cold-ERG 1-PST-wake.up=1M.DO
‘Cold woke me up.’ (12.91) Dust’im inaman arrijin, namarda gala gajoordnim boolgar injoon.
Dust’im i-na-ma-n arrijin, namarda gala gajoord-nim dust.off 3-TR-put-CONT nothing just already ashes-ERG boolgar i-n-joo-n. white 3-TR-do/say-CONT
‘No one dusted him off, and the ash still made him look white.’ (BMF.013)
The quasi-passive construction does not freely alternate with active clauses in the language, although minimal pairs can be constructed. It thus has few properties of a real passive.

Chapter 13 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
1. Introduction
Complex predicate constructions are one of the most important components in the grammar of Bardi. Complex predicates appear in many sentences and outnumber simple predicates in absolute numbers by more than 3:1. They are even more numerous in texts. When verbs are borrowed, they are borrowed as preverbs in complex predicate constructions, not as inﬂecting verbs. Complex predicates are also productively formed from adjectives.173
Complex predicates do not, however, form a homogeneous set. There are several different types, with different semantics, and with a light verb fulﬁlling different functional roles. Bardi seems to show idiomatic complex predicates, event classiﬁcation, and a type of pseudo-incorporation of direct objects; each type of complex predicate involves different verbs and possibly different syntax. The complex predicate system should also be examined in the context of other types of verbal predicates in Bardi. After all, although complex predicates form a very important component of predicate formation in Nyulnyulan languages, they are not the only way to form verbal predicates and they should be treated as part of the syntax of predicates as a whole, both verbal and non-verbal.
Bardi’s complex predicates comprise an inﬂected verb combined with an uninﬂecting preverb174 which immediately precedes the light verb. There are almost 1000 recorded preverbs in the Bardi dictionary. About 30 inﬂected verbs may appear as light verbs in this construction, although only 10 are very frequent. One verb, -joo- ‘say, do’ accounts for about 40% of the possible preverb light verb pairs. Other common light verbs include -ma- ‘put’, -ar- ‘spear (lice), pierce’ the phonologically null root meaning ‘give’ (here represented by -ø-), and -ni- ‘sit.’
The chapter begins with diagnostics for complex predicates and discussion of how argument role assignment is determined. In §13.6 I examine the composition of complex predicates in more detail. Speciﬁcally, I examine the semantics of light verbs and the contribution of the light verb to the predicate as a whole. I follow McGregor (2002) in considering the light verb to make a contribution to the classiﬁcation of the preverb, although there are

504 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

aspects of his analysis which I cannot sustain for Bardi, and I argue that not all preverb-light verb constructions involve classiﬁcation. It is also necessary to consider what contribution the light verb makes to the argument and event structures of the predicate. In §13.9 I propose that Nyulnyulan complex predicate constructions ﬁt into a larger set of classiﬁcatory preverb-light verb complex predicates. Indeed, they ﬁt a larger cross-linguistic pattern of the use of light verbs to mark one of four categories of what can be broadly called ‘event structure’. That is, I argue ultimately that one of the main functions of light verbs is to add an event variable to the structure of the predicate.
I follow Butt and Geuder (2001:325) in considering light verb constructions as a type of complex predicate which consists of a main lexical verb in combination with a lexically defective verb (of course not all complex predicates are V V constructions, and not all V V constructions are complex predicates). I assume Butt’s features of complex predicates (extracted from Butt and Geuder 2001:323-327; see also Butt 1995:2). The deﬁnition provided by Alsina, Bresnan, and Sells (1997:1) is similar: each component of the complex predicate contributes to the predicate information normally associated with a head.
The deﬁnition which Butt (1995:2) provides for complex predicates is given below in (13.1):

(13.1)

a. complex predicates are multi-headed: argument structure is complex;
b. they are composed of more than one grammatical element, each of which contributes part of the information normally associated with a head;
c. their grammatical functional structure, however, is that of a simple predicate;
d. light verb structures can be formed lexically or syntactically.

Thus complex predicates are ‘complex’ because they consist of two (or more) constituents which do the work of a single verb; the functions of the predicate are spread across multiple constituents.
My presentation of Bardi complex predicates here is primarily descriptive. For example, I do not make formal arguments for an analysis of how preverb and light verbs each contribute to the argument structure of a predicate. I informally assume a uniﬁcation analysis (see further Bowern 2008b,d, McConvell and Bowern 2011a, Wilson 1999). More speciﬁcally, I assume that

Tests for complex predicate status 505
coverbs are able to contribute to the argument structure of a predicate, and that both the preverb and the light verb license arguments; however, preverbs lack information about event structure, and this makes them unable to surface in the syntax without a light verb which provides that information.

2. Tests for complex predicate status

In this section I examine the evidence for proposing that Bardi has X+V complex predicates. Tests involving constituent order are difﬁcult to administer in Bardi, because constituent order is very free. Not every item that stands immediately before a light verb is a preverb. There are, however, a few constituency tests we can apply, in order to disambiguate preverbal constituents (for example, the object in sentences with surface order OV) from preverbs forming complex predicates. To test for predicatehood and predicate status we need tests that are associated with the functions of predicates. It is uncontroversial that thematic role assignment, clausal transitivity, and clausal aspect are determined by the head of the predicate, and furthermore that Aktionsart is also a property of predicate heads. The following sections provide evidence for complex predicate status, and the tests are speciﬁc to Bardi.175
Tests for determining the preverb word class were given in §4.4 above. A list of verbs which may be light verbs in complex predicates was given in Tables 9.4 and 9.5 on pages 390–391 above. Discussion here will focus on the most common light verbs, repeated for convenience in Table 13.1 below.

506 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
2.1. Word status
Preverbs in Nyulnyulan languages are almost always independent phonological words. They have their own primary stress, as does the light verb. However, monosyllabic preverbs tend to cliticize to their inﬂecting verb. In (13.2) the preverbs darr ‘come, arrive’ and arr ‘come, go’ cliticize to their light verbs, -ar- and -joo- ∼ -di- respectively. There is phonological reduction accompanying the cliticization here.
(13.2) a. da(r)narna < darr inarn ‘he came’ b. andan < arr indan ‘he’s coming/going’
This is evidence that the syntactic relationship between the two items is a close one. The only other words which regularly cliticize to a host are sentential particles and possessive pronouns (see §7.4).
Further indirect evidence for the word status of preverbs, particularly longer preverbs (where cliticization evidence cannot be used effectively), comes from native speaker intuitions. Speakers say of preverbs that they are a word on their own, but the word doesn’t ‘sound complete’ without the accompanying inﬂecting verb. Speakers are also very reluctant to assign glosses to preverbs without an accompanying inﬂected light verb.

2.2. Sentential clitic placement

Further evidence that the preverb and light verb form a close unit comes from the placement of clausal clitics. These clitics, just as =gid ‘then’ and =(j)amba ‘that’s why’ are strictly placed after the ﬁrst constituent in the clause. For example, if the ﬁrst phrase in the clause is a complex noun phrase, the clitic occurs obligatorily after the ﬁrst noun. This is illustrated in (13.3) (see also the discussion in §4.7):

(13.3)

a. Ginyinggigid oorany bard ingarrayi booroojinangan. [Ginyinggi=gid oorany] bard i-ng-arr-a-yi 3MIN=THEN woman off 3-PST-AUG-take booroo=jina-ngan. place=3MIN-ALL

‘They took this woman home.’

(CTSI/116)

Tests for complex predicate status 507

b. * [Ginyinggi oorany]=gid bard

i-ng-arr-a-yi

3MIN

woman=THEN off

booroo=jina-ngan.

3-PST-AUG-take place 3MIN-ALL

When a complex predicate is ﬁrst in the clause, however, the clitic may appear attached either to the preverb or to the light verb. Speakers say that either order is possible and there is no meaning difference. Illustration is provided in (13.4). In these examples, the phrasal clitic is the allative case -ngan (see further §5.4.4). It is used in nominalizations and purposive clauses.

(13.4)

a. Roowilngan manyan gornamb.

[Roowil]-ngan ma-nya-n

gorn=amb.

walk-ALL

GER-catch-CONT good=THUS

‘Walking is good/it’s good to walk.’

(NI: BOW-FN11/26)

b. [Roowil ma-nya-n]-ngan gorn=amb. walk-ALL GER-catch-CONT good=THUS

Thus the individual parts of a complex predicate may be treated as a single constituent for the purposes of clitic placement.

2.3. Lack of decompositional semantics

The semantics of many preverb-light verb pairs can be decomposed into a preverbal component and the light verb. For example, it is easy to analyze those adjectives which combine with -ni- ‘sit, be, exist’ as involving a existential component and the preverb.

(13.5) maanka -ni- ‘be black’ (cf. maanka ‘black (adj)’, -ni- ‘sit, be, exist’)

Many other preverb-light verb pairs, however, have highly idiomatic readings which must be listed phrasally in the lexicon. Two examples are given below.

(13.6)

a. girringg -arcough ‘spear’ ‘cough’
b. girringgirringg -ar- ‘cough up phlegm, expectorate’

508 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

(13.7)

a. liyan -(i)nyaheart ‘catch’ ‘breathe’
b. liyan -gaheart ‘carry’ ‘carry a grudge’
c. liyan -maheart ‘put’ ‘want something’

Reduplication of the preverb in a complex predicate usually causes a pluractional or iterative reading. In (13.6), however, it is idiomatic and refers to the productivity of the cough. In (13.7) changing the light verb associated with liyan (which as a noun means ‘heart, feelings’ or ‘breath’) radically changes the meaning of the verb phrase. This implies that such collocations are stored in the lexicon as whole phrases.

2.4. Reduplication

Many adjectives cannot be reduplicated when they have a nominal complement, but reduplication is possible when they are functioning as preverbs, as shown in the following sentences. Garrja ‘sharp’ cannot be reduplicated when used attributively to a noun, but reduplication as a preverb is acceptable.

(13.8)

a. * garrjagarrja jamooyoon sharp-REDUP knife ‘a sharp knife’

b. Garrjagarrja anama!

Garrjagarrja a-na-ma!

sharpen

2.IMP-TR-put-FUT

‘Sharpen it!’

(NI: CB/20.6:54)

This is true for many other adjectives and provides further evidence for a distinct class of preverbs. That is, the status as a preverb (as compared to an adjective) changes the derivational possibilities of the root.

Argument and thematic role assignment 509

2.5. Negation

Normally negation directly precedes the inﬂecting verb, as in example (13.9) below. Importantly, the only item which may intervene between the negator arra and the inﬂecting verb is the preverb, as illustrated in (13.10).176 The reverse order is ungrammatical.

(13.9) Arra oolalana. Arra oo- l[a]- (j)ala -na NEG 3.F/I- IRR- see -REM.PST

(13.10)

‘He didn’t see it.’

a. Arra jiidara ngalamanajiy irrola.

Arra jiidara nga-la-ma-na=jiy

irrola.

NEG bewitch 1-IRR-put-REM.PST=2MIN.IO spear.

‘I didn’t bewitch your spear.’

b. * Jiidara arra nga-la-ma-na=jiy

irrola.

bewitch NEG 1-IRR-put-REM.PST=2MIN.IO spear.

(CB/BE: 11/57)

This fact about negation placement provides us with a constituency test— an item is acting as a preverb if it appears between the negator arra and the inﬂecting verb. This allows us to disambiguate uses of adverbs and direct objects which can appear outside negation. In (13.11), for example, all orders with the order NEG + verb are acceptable, although the ﬁrst is preferred.

(13.11)

a. Arra joodarrarr oo-l-ala-na. NEG with.the.tide 3-IRR-visit-REM.PST

‘He didn’t go with the tide.’

b. Joodarrarr arra oo-l-ala-na. with.the.tide NEG 3-IRR-visit-REM.PST

c. Arra oo-l-ala-na

joodarrarr.

NEG 3-IRR-visit-REM.PST with.the.tide

(BOW-FN.12/26)

3. Argument and thematic role assignment
As seen in Chapter 12 above, I assume a model of grammar in which verbs control the type and number of arguments which in their clauses. No single

510 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

part of the complex predicate determines the number and type of arguments of the predicate. Nor is it the case that the preverb determines semantic roles (such as agent and patient), while the light verb licenses the number of arguments which may appear. The components of complex predicates jointly determine the argument structure of the clause. I use the term thematic role here to refer to the determination of the number and type of arguments in the clause.177 In Bardi, we ﬁnd that thematic role assignment is determined by a combination of the verb morphology (transitivity marking and applicative sufﬁx), the light verb, and the preverb. There appear to be complex predicates which differ in the roles assigned to arguments, where in each case a different part of the complex predicate is responsible for the change in role assignment. These facts are described below.
First, inﬂectional verb morphology may change thematic role assignment. The addition of -nginj, for example, adds a role to those assigned within the complex predicate, as shown in (13.12) below:

(13.12)

a. Yoorr

a-na-ma!

come.down 2.IMP-TR-put-FUT

‘Come down!’ (1 semantic role; agent)

b. Yoorr

a-na-mi-nginji!

come.down 2.IMP-TR-put-APPL

‘Come down with him!’ (2 semantic roles; agent, accompanier)

In (13.13), we see that the use of a different light verb changes the thematic role assigned to the subject of the clause. The preverb is abarrabarr, which as a noun means ‘confusion’. When combined with the light verb -ma- ‘put’, it means ‘to be careless’, and the single role is a theme. When the light verb is -ga- ‘carry’, however, two thematic roles are assigned, an agent and a patient. Thus both transitivity and thematic role composition are affected here.

(13.13) a. abarrabarr -ma- ‘to be careless’ b. abarrabarr -ga- ‘to lead someone astray’

Finally, the choice of preverb also alters the roles licensed by the predicate. In (13.14) we keep the same light verb, -(i)nya- ‘catch’, and change the preverb. Reduplicating the preverb can also change the thematic structure of the predicate, as shown in (13.15).

(13.14) a. niyarra -(i)nya- ‘taste something’ (experiencer)

Argument and thematic role assignment 511

(13.15)

b. roowil -(i)nya- ‘walk’ (agent) a. anggoorr -ma- ‘mourn for someone’ (experiencer) b. anggoorranggoorr -ma- ‘comfort someone’ (agent)

The pairs given in the previous few examples highlight the fact that thematic role assignment can be determined by several parts of the predicate.

3.1. Aspect/Aktionsart

In aspect and Aktionsart marking, no single part of the predicate is responsible, and distinctions can be marked by the choice of light verb, the preverb, or the inﬂecting verb morphology.
In (13.16), we see that the continuative -n or the middle perfect -ij determines aspect for the whole predicate. The (a) sentence shows a general, unmarked non-punctual event (the sentence could also be translated ‘as soon as I’m walking. . . ), while the (b) sentence shows one that is completed.

(13.16)

a. Aaman roowil ngannyan, gala inngoorroobinngay iilanim.

Aaman roowil nga-n-nya-n,

gala

as.soon.as walk 1M-TR-catch-CONT, right.then

i-n-ngoorroo-bi-n=ngay iila-nim.

3MIN-chase-1MIN.DO dog-ERG

‘As soon as I go for a walk, the dog chases me.’

b. Moonboorran roowil innyij. Moonboorran roowil i-n-ny-ij. towards.speaker walk 3-TR-catch-MID.PFV

‘He came towards me.’

In (13.17), however, we see that the light verb can also be responsible for contributing aspectual information. The use of -jarrala- ‘run’ with the preverb joornk ‘run’ contributes a speciﬁcally inceptive reading to the complex predicate, whereas -(i)nya- ‘catch’ does not.

(13.17)

a. Joornk innyana. Joornk i-n-nya-na. run 3MIN-‘put’-REM.PST
‘He ran away (quickly).’

512 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

b. Joornk inyjarralana. Joornk i-ny-jarrala-na. run 3MIN-run-REM.PST
‘He took off with speed.’

Finally, we see from (13.18) the the reduplication of the preverb also changes aspect. Reduplicated preverbs often signal iterative, repetitive or pluractional actions. The example in (13.18) is iterative.

(13.18)

a. Bany inamana boorroo. Bany i-na-ma-na boorroo. shoot 3MIN-put-PST kangaroo
‘He shot the kangaroo.’ b. Banybany inamana.
Bany-bany i-na-ma-na. shoot-REDUP 3MIN-put-PST
‘He kept on shooting [it].’

In (13.16), the tense/aspect sufﬁx changes the aspect of the clause. In (13.17), the choice of light verb determines whether the reading is completive or inceptive. In (13.18), it is the reduplication of the preverb which provides the iterative reading.178

4. Valency and transitivity in complex predicate constructions
In examining how many arguments a predicate may take, we ﬁnd again that this can be altered by the appropriate choice of verb morphology, light verb, or preverb. The applicative sufﬁx -ng, for example, promotes an oblique argument to a direct object. Remember from Chapter 12 that valency-changing verbal morphology is limited in Bardi to the reﬂexive/reciprocal circumﬁx m- -inyja, which makes inﬂecting verbs structurally monovalent, and the applicative -ng, which can be added to transitive or intransitive stems to derive a new transitive verb by promoting an oblique adjunct to a direct object.179
In (13.19) and (13.20) we see some of the results of adding valencychanging morphology to a verb stem. In (13.19) the preverb is barn; using the active form of the verb -joo- results in a complex predicate meaning ‘tell

Valency and transitivity in complex predicate constructions 513

someone to do something.’ In (13.19b), however, we see that adding the reﬂexive circumﬁx removes an argument from the entire predicate. In (13.20) we see an example of argument addition, by means of the applicative sufﬁx -ng(a).

(13.19) (13.20)

a. Barn injoogaljarrngay. Barn i-n-joo-gal=jarrngay. tell 3-PST-do/say-IMPERF-1M.DO

‘He told me to do something.’

b. Barn ingiminyjigal. Barn i-ngi-m-inyji-gal. tell 3-PST-REFL1-‘do/say’-REFL2-IMPFV
‘He thought about it.’

a. Diird injoogal.

Diird

i-n-joo-gal.

go/run away 3-PST-do/say-IPFV

‘He went away.’

b. Diird injoonggal.

Diird

i-n-joo-ng-gal.

go/run away 3-PST-do/say-APPL2-IPFV

‘He went with someone.’

In (13.21) and (13.22) we see that the light verb also affects the transitivity of the predicate. The examples in the (a) sentences are intransitive and show a single argument, while the (b) sentences have two arguments and are transitive.

(13.21) (13.22)

a. Boorroolboorrool oonkara oola.

Boorroolboorrool oo-n-k-ar-a

o˙ ola.

boil-REDUP

b. Boorroolboorrool oonkama oola.

a. goojaj -joo- ‘to feel weak’ (one argument)

514 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

b. goojaj -ma- ‘to make someone weak’ (two arguments)

Finally, we see from (13.23) and (13.24) that the preverb also controls aspects of the transitivity of the predicate. The examples provide two light verbs whose non-light counterparts are bivalent. The resulting complex predicates, however, are either transitive or intransitive, depending on the preverb:

(13.23) -ma- ‘to put’ (2 obligatory arguments) a. jiibard -ma- ‘to sneak up’ (1 argument) b. niya -ma- ‘to rest’ (1 argument) c. oona -ma- ‘to defecate’ (1 argument) d. wajim -ma- ‘to wash something’ (2 arguments)
(13.24) -(i)nya- ‘to catch, to pick up’ (2 obligatory arguments) a. ngalar -(i)nya- ‘to have one’s eyes open’ (1 argument) b. marrmarr -(i)nya- ‘to ﬂash’ (1 argument) c. galgooriny -(i)nya- ‘to swim breaststroke’ (1 argument) d. roowil -(i)nya- ‘to walk’ (1 argument) e. joony -(i)nya- ‘suck something’ (2 arguments) f. bawinbawin -(i)nya- ‘cut up something’ (2 arguments)

It would be possible to argue that the preverb occupies an argument slot of the inﬂecting verb for some of the above examples. However, it requires a very forced interpretation in many cases. There is no evidence, for example, that speakers analyze bawinbawin -inya- as ‘catch a cutting’. It also leaves us with the problem of what to do with the formally intransitive verbs that take preverbs in addition to their external argument, such as -ni- ‘sit’ and -jiidi‘go’. There are also transitive light verbs that take two arguments (e.g. garboo -ma- ‘to dig around something’), but no evidence for ditransitive verbs in the language. If the preverb were occupying the object slot of the verb argument structure (or saturating the patient role), the following examples would be ungrammatical, but they are good.

5. Light verb derivation

A further argument in favor of a complex predicate analysis is that some light verbs change their behavior in preverb-inﬂection verb constructions. For example, the verb -banji- ‘to share’ can be reduplicated when it is not being used as a light verb. The same verb is ungrammatical reduplicated in a light verb construction:

(13.27)

a. ingarrbanjanji i-ng-arr-banjanji 3-PST-AUG-REDUP-share
‘They (all) shared it.’ b. *maanka ingarrbanjanji
[intended:‘they kept on making each other black’] (CB-FN3)

Light verbs more generally show very limited possibilities for derivation. No light verbs can be reduplicated, except for -gala- ‘move’, which does combine with a few preverbs even when reduplicated (however, it is possible to argue that the reduplicated use of -gala- is not a productive derivation but a distinct use of the reduplicated full verb as a light verb; see further §13.9.2.6). Light verbs do not generally allow reﬂexive/reciprocal derivation either, again with a single exception, that of -joo- ‘do, say’, whose reﬂexive/reciprocal form -m-inyji- can be used in a limited way to derive reﬂexive/reciprocal complex predicates. This is described in more detail in §12.3.2. The possibilities for applicative derivations are also highly circumscribed. Thus in summary, light verbs do not participate in most of the valency and argument structure alternations that characterize other inﬂecting verbs.

516 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
6. Syntax of Bardi complex predicates
We have already seen a great deal of the behavior of Bardi complex predicates in the previous section. In this section I discuss in detail additional topics which do not fall under the heading of demonstrating that the construction in question is a complex predicate.

6.1. Constituent order within complex predicates

There is considerable variation in the extent to which preverbs and their light verb may be separated among Nyulnyulan languages. The order of preverb and light verb is much more rigidly ﬁxed in Bardi than might be supposed from descriptions of other Nyulnyulan languages. We also ﬁnd statements, however, that the ‘normal order’ in all Nyulnyulan languages for preverb and light verb is preverb—light verb, and alternative orders are seldom found (Hosokawa 1991, McGregor 1994b, 1996b).
In Bardi, it appears that the only time a preverb may be moved around the clause is when it is an ‘adverbial’ preverb and the meaning of the complex predicate is strictly compositional. (13.11) is repeated below as (13.28), which shows varying order for the preverb and the rest of the complex predicate. The ‘preverb’ is bolded

(13.28)

a. Arra joodarrarr oolalana. Arra joodarrarr oo-l-ala-na. NEG with.the.tide 3-IRR-visit-REM.PST

‘He didn’t go with the tide.’

b. Joodarrarr arra oolalana.

Joodarrarr arra oo-l-ala-na.

with.the.tide NEG 3-IRR-visit-REM.PST

c. Arra oolalana joodarrarr.

Arra oo-l-ala-na

joodarrarr.

NEG 3-IRR-visit-REM.PST with.the.tide

Given this strong restriction on constituency, the cases illustrated in (13.28b) and (13.28c) are probably not complex predicates within the strict deﬁnition of the term, and joodarrarr is acting as a straightforward adverb in such cases, despite the same meaning of (13.28) and the other clauses. Note that a strictly

Syntax of Bardi complex predicates 517

compositional interpretation of (13.28b) is ‘he didn’t go around with the tide,’ which is identical in meaning to the more idiomatic complex predicate. The other examples of variable ‘preverb’ ordering in Bardi are all such cases, where the preverb and light verb meanings are strictly compositional.
There are further examples where the preverb–light verb ordering is important and contributes to a change in meaning in the predicate: contrast between garndi+ -ma- (complex predicate) ‘make it high’ vs. -ma- garndi (gaalwon) ‘put it on top’; the latter, as illustrated in (13.29), is analytical, and not a complex predicate at all.

(13.29) Ingarramagal garndi goorlil gaalwon.

I-nga-rra-ma-gal

garndi goorlil gaalw-on.

3-PST-AUG-put-REC.PST top turtle raft-LOC

‘They put it on top of the mangrove raft.’

(CB-FN07/1)

6.2. Preverb conjunction

Discussion of conjunction is provided in §16.4. In contrast with the conjunction of noun phrases, whole verb phrases, and clauses, preverb conjunction never occurs in spontaneous speech. The conjunction of preverbs with agal ‘and’ is very rarely accepted. A few examples were considered grammatical; these are given in (13.30). Much more often, however, examples with this structure which were presented to speakers were rephrased, either with two complex predicates joined by agal ‘and’, or using two verb phrases with no overt conjunction. The examples in (13.31) show the preferred pattern of conjunction.

(13.30)

a. Bilirl agal girringg nga-n-ar-ij bardi.

[Bilirl agal girringg] nga-n-ar-ij

bardi.

‘I yawned and coughed all day yesterday.’ (NI: BOW-FN.3/47)

b. Jooyiboon wiinya i-n-j-ij agal rambin.

‘The pot got full and heavy.’

(13.31)

a. Bilirl nganarij bardi agal girringgirring nganarij.

Bilirl nga-n-ar-ij

bardi agal girringgirring

yawn 1-TR-spear-MID.PFV yesterday and cough

nga-n-ar-ij.

1-TR-spear-MID.PFV

‘I yawned and coughed all day yesterday.’ (= (13.30a))

b. Liyan alig injijinin agal diirdamb inin.

Liyan alig i-n-j-ij=in=in

agal diirdamb

heart sore 3-TR-do/say-PFV=3.IO and away=THUS

i-ni-n.

3-be-CONT

‘He got angry and left.’

(13.30a) shows a genuine conjunction of preverbs before the verb. The bracketing is:

(13.32) [Bilirl agal girringg] pv nganarij V bardi IP.
In (13.30b), however, we would appear to have a gapped second verb, or movement of part of the phrase, stranding the second preverb (I prefer an analysis, if this is a complex predicate, where the second verb injij is understood).
Note that in (13.31b) the preverb diird ‘leave’ can take either -joo- ‘do/say’ or -ni- ‘be’ as its light verb. If true preverbs can be freely conjoined in Bardi, there should be no reason why a phrase such as liyan alig agal diird injijin should be ungrammatical. The fact that the only possible conjoined preverbs are also members of other word classes, and even then that the unconjoined phrase is preferred, should be a clue that the ‘preverbs’ in such cases are probably not functioning as preverbs.

6.3. Multiple preverbs
There are a few instances in Bardi of constructions where the preverb appears to be a multi-word phrase. Representative complex predicates are given in (13.33). The phrases in (13.33) have been identiﬁed as complex predicates on the basis of intonation and negation.

Syntax of Bardi complex predicates 519

(13.33)

a. bard arr -joooff go do/say ‘go off’
b. bard roowil -nyaoff walk catch ‘walk off’
c. liyan layib -maheart well put ‘make someone happy’
d. liyan loogal -jooheart bad do/say ‘be upset’
e. liyan loogal -maheart bad put ‘make someone [IO] angry’

Such preverbs fall into two types. In the ﬁrst, the ﬁrst preverb is an adverb, usually bard ‘away, off’. In the second type, the second verb in the preverbal construction modiﬁes the ﬁrst.

6.4. Referential status of preverbs
Preverbs can be derived from different word classes, including nouns. Denominal preverbs are fairly clearly non-referential in almost all contexts. For example, they never allow modiﬁcation with a demonstrative or adjective, and examples like ‘I message-sent sad’ (for ‘I sent a sad message.’) are only found when the adjective is functioning adverbially. There are two possible exceptions to this. The ﬁrst involves the phrase jawal -ma- ‘tell a story’ (literally ‘story put’). Examples such as (13.34) appear at ﬁrst site to have a preverb (jawal ‘story’) that is modiﬁed by an adjective moorroolangarr ‘little’.
(13.34) Jawal nganman jarri moorroolangarr.
Jawal nga-n-ma-n jarri moorrool=angarr. story 1-TR-put-CONT this little=only
‘I’ll tell this story, just a little one.’

520 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
There is reason to believe, however, that jawal -ma- is an idiom, rather than a complex predicate.180 The components of the idiom occur in the opposite order; that is, jiiba nganman jawal ‘I’ll tell this story’ is also a frequent way to start a narrative. Furthermore, instead of -ma- ‘put’, it is possible to use the verb -jilngi- ‘tell’, which is a full lexical verb, not a light verb. Third, since this is the only preverbal item which appears to have referential properties such as demonstrative or adjectival modiﬁcation, it is likely that this construction is an idiomatic noun + verb combination, not a true complex predicate.
The only other potential preverb class with referential properties comprises those preverbs, discussed in §13.6.7.2 below, which are inalienably possessed nouns. (13.35) provides an example with the noun +ga ‘back’, which here appears with ﬁrst person minimal marking.
(13.35) Ngaya ngankama wiira.
Nga-ya nga-n-ka-m-a wiira. 1M-back 1-FUT-TR-put-FUT little.while
‘I am going to rest for a little while.’
I tentatively assume here that ngaya ‘my back’ is not strictly referential here, but rather is receiving its possessive agreement marking from the subject of the verb. Further research in this area is needed, however.
6.5. Independent usage of preverbs
There is little independent usage of preverbs without their inﬂecting verb in Bardi.181 In the modern language, the only preverbs which may be used without a light verb are those which have cognates in other word classes, and which form compositional complex predicates. In (13.36), for example, the sentence could probably be equally well translated ‘he walked away with a song’. In (13.37), the phrase is bangalonngan oogool ‘for scattering in the crevices’, where oogool is the preverb. The only inﬂecting verb in the sentence, irrjimbin ‘they die’, is in a different clause. I thus assume that these are not true complex predicates.

Syntax of Bardi complex predicates 521

Roowil i-n-ny-ij

ﬁsh.poison

‘Banyjoord poison root is used for scattering in crevices of reefs so that the ﬁsh die. It’s from the mainland.’ (Aklif 1999:banyjoord)

(13.38) Jooboolngan jirra.

Joobool-ngan

jirra.

swimming-ALL/PURP 3AUG.POSS

‘They are going swimming.’

(BOW-FN.12/26)

When the preverb exists only as a preverb, the inﬂecting verb may not be omitted and must appear with gerund inﬂection. (13.39) illustrates this with the preverb roowil ‘walk’.

(13.39)

a. Roowil-ngan manyan

gorn=amb.

walk-ALL GER-catch-CONT good=THUS

‘It’s good to walk.’

(NI: BOW-FN.11/26)

b. * Roowil-ngan gorn=amb. walk-ALL good=THUS

Another good test for nominal status is presence in the phrase of gorna jina X, meaning ‘his/her X is good’. Only independent nominals can appear in this frame, preverbs, verbs, particles and adjectives cannot. Although roowil fails all other nominal tests, including the use of a preverb without a light verb, it passes this one: gorna jina roowil ‘his walk is good’ was acceptable.

522 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

There are some hints from the Laves data that the use of preverbs without light verbs used to be a little freer in Bardi. There are a few examples of the preverb roowil ‘walk’ without a light verb, and with other preverbs (e.g. as illustrated in (13.40)):

(13.40) Jama, gala jawa barda gaalwa galgoorriny.

Jama, gala jawa

barda gaalwa galgoorriny.

well thus 1+2MIN.IO off raft swimming

‘Well, let’s us two swim together, ﬂoating on the catamaran.’ (L129.015)

McGregor also reports the use of preverbs without light verbs in Nyulnyul. In the Eastern Nyulnyulan languages, the situation is rather different. There are several constructions where the preverb may be used independently, as seen from the Nyikina example in (13.41).

(13.41) Nyikina

Gurd nga-rra-ma gab-dyunu

mangarriy-dyunu.

die 1MIN-IRR-go eat-INAN.SOURCE food-INAN.SOURCE

‘I might die from eating the food.’

(Stokes 1982a:144)

Finally, it is worth noting that the oldest Bardi speakers, who regularly codeswitch between English and Bardi, occasionally use Bardi preverbs in an English or Kriol frame. In (13.42), for example, the preverb garr ‘rub’ has been used as a Kriol verb root would, complete with past tense marker bin and transitivity marker ’im.

(13.42) They bin garring’im. (They were rubbing it.)

(NI)

Compare also the discussion in Schultze-Berndt (2000:143) for similar examples from Jaminjung speakers. I do not have a large enough set of examples to draw any conclusions for Bardi.

6.6. Applicatives and complex predicates
An interesting feature of complex predicates in Bardi is that the applicative2 is not productively used with them, even in cases where we might expect them

Syntax of Bardi complex predicates 523

to be grammatical, judging by the evidence of their use in simple predicates.
Consider the sentences in (13.43). The (a) sentence shows a verb without the applicative, while the (b) sentence is with the applicative.182

(13.43)

a. Maanka inamana Maanka i-na-ma-na. black 3-TR-put-REM.PST
‘He made it black.’ b. Maanka inamanang.
Maanka i-na-ma-n-ang. black 3-TR-put-REM.PST-APPL2 ‘He left a black thing with them.’
*‘He made it black with something/someone.’ (Speaker’s translation: ‘He bin leave that maanka longa them.’)

The translation in (13.43b) was given by the speaker, Nancy Isaac. Using the applicative with this complex predicate forces a reading where maanka ‘black’ is not a preverb, but rather an adjective modifying an assumed noun (recall from §4.2 and (4.6) that adjectives may be used without an accompanying noun if the discourse referent is already established). The root -mais also interpreted in its non-light meaning ‘put’, rather than its light verb meaning, where it often acts as a causative.
Some light verbs can combine with the applicative, however:

(13.44) Roowil innyanang. Roowil i-n-nya-n-ang. walk 3-TR-catch-REM.PST-APPL2
‘He walked with someone.’

In other cases the applicative of a complex predicate produces a noncompositional meaning (cf. (13.43) above). In (13.45) the non-applicative (intransitive) version means, innocuously, ‘they are living in the same camp’. When the same complex predicate is used with the applicative, however, the phrase means ‘they are having an orgy’:

(13.45) a. gir irral ‘they’re living in a place [together]’ (group of people sharing a camp)
b. gir(gir) ingarralanggal ‘they’re having an orgy’

524 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

6.7. Inﬂection of preverbs

6.7.1. Aspect marking

In the other Nyulnyulan languages, and indeed in many of the languages of Northern Australia, preverbs inﬂect for aspect. In Yawuru, for example, they may take -kadya, which is an intensive marker. In Nyulnyul the equivalent morpheme is -garra.183 In the Daly River area of the Northern Territory, -ma is commonly used (see further Wilson 1999) to mark completive aspect.
In Bardi, however, the inﬂection which preverbs may take is highly limited. The only even remotely productive derivation which some preverbs may undergo is reduplication.184
Preverbs cannot usually take the adjectival intensive marker =gij; instead an adverb ngarrigij is used. The few preverbs that seem to contain =gij may be fossilized (e.g. abarrabarrgij ‘difﬁcult’, where abarrabarr is a noun meaning ‘confusion’, not an adjective).

(13.46) Ngarrigij boorrooboorr inyjiid nyimarl.

Ngarrigij boorrooboorr i-ny-jiid nyi-marl.

very-VERY swell

3-PST-go 2M-hand.

‘Your arm got too/very swollen.’

(13.47) * boorrooboorr=gij i-ny-jiid nyi-marl.

swell=VERY

3-PST-go 2M-hand.

(BOW-FN3/67)

Although it seems that there is no active derivation which targets the preverb position, this does not mean that no inﬂected items can be preverbs. In fact, two forms of inﬂection are found on preverbs. The ﬁrst is inalienable possession markers; the second is case marking.

6.7.2. Inalienable possession
Recall from §4.2 and Table 4.1 that Bardi has a set of inalienably possessed nouns which take preﬁxes for the person and number of the possessor (cf. ngalma ‘my head’, nyalma ‘your head’, etc). Several of these inalienably possessed nouns can be used as preverbs in complex predicate constructions. A representative sample is given in the following examples:
(13.48) a. +ga ‘back’ Ngaya ngankama wiira.

Syntax of Bardi complex predicates 525

Nga-ya nga-n-ka-m-a wiira. 1MIN-back 1-FUT-TR-put-FUT little.while

(NI: AK/FN E3/41)

526 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

The use of agreeing possession preﬁxes on the preverbs seems to be optional; in (13.51) and (13.52), for example, the preverb takes default, third person minimal agreement (ni-) rather than agreeing with any particular participant.

(13.51) +ngarrarda ‘spirit’ (= ‘believe’): Ningarrarda anamajin gala injilnganjirri jawal.

may?

3M.POSSR-taste 1-TR-FUT-catch-FUT 2M.POSS tucker.

‘May I taste your food?’

The case of +moonggoon is an interesting one. The verb appears to be impersonal, and the ‘learner’ is the possessor of the preverb, as shown in (13.53); see also (13.48b) above:

(13.53) Gala ngamoonggoon indan gorna. Alboorr ngaanka ngangankan.

Gala nga-moonggoon i-n-d-an

gorna. Alboorr

ngaanka nga-nganka-n.

word 1-speak-CONT.

‘I am learning [Bardi] well. I can say lots of words.’

In other cases, the possessor is the logical object of the light verb (and sometimes, as in the case of +moonggoon -ma- ‘teach someone’, it may alternate with object marking on the verb). Examples of this were given in (13.49) above.

Syntax of Bardi complex predicates 527

6.7.3. Case and other marking

Another type of inﬂection found on preverbs is case marking. This is not productive, and almost all examples are instances of the locative case on an identiﬁable noun, combined with the light verb -ni- ‘sit, be at a place’ or -gal(a)- ‘move’. An example of each is given in (13.54)–(13.55).

(13.54) (13.55)

a. gor-on -gal- ‘play’ (lit. gaara ‘at game’ + ‘move’) b. aarl-on -gal- ‘go ﬁshing’ (lit. aarli ‘at ﬁsh’ + ‘move’) c. moorrgool-on -gal- ‘work’ (lit. moorrgool ‘at work’ + ‘move’) a. wiliwil-on -ni- ‘be ﬁshing’ (lit. wiliwili ‘at ﬁshing line’ + ‘sit’) b. aarl-on -ni- ‘be ﬁshing’ (lit. aarli ‘at ﬁsh’ + ‘sit’) c. anggoorr-goon -ni- ‘be in tears’ (lit. anggoorr ‘at tears’ + ‘sit’)

There is also some evidence for there having been other inﬂected preverbs at a previous stage in the language, although they are not treated as such in the modern language. One striking example is liyan -ma- ‘like, want’, which in the Laves corpus often appears with the instrumental -ng(a).185

(13.56) Boonyjanim aamba oorany arr irrmoonggoon ginyinggi Rooji liyannga inamana Marroolal monjanngan.

want 3-TR-put-REM.PST M.

GER-spear-CONT-ALL

‘All the people didn’t know that Rooji wanted to spear Marroolal.’ (L102.009)

Finally, a few preverbs appear to contain a sufﬁx -j or -ja, or have variants with or without a ﬁnal consonant:

(13.57) a. booljarrja -jalgoo-. ‘to faint’ (cf. booljarr (adv) ‘suddenly’) b. rarrjin -ma- ∼ rarrjinja+ ‘feel shame’
(13.58) jiinba -(i)nya- ∼ jiinbany -(i)nya- ‘avoid a weapon’

Inﬂection with -ja is not productive. It could be related either to the simultaneity marker -j or to the -j that occasionally appears on predicate adjectives (see §5.1.11.3).

528 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

6.8. Loans

Many preverbs are in origin loan words from other languages, including other Nyulnyulan languages and English or Kriol. Some examples from English/Kriol are given in (13.59). The English translation also contains the source of the loan.

(13.59)

a. dayid -joo- ‘be/get tired’ b. diil -joo- ‘deal (cards)’ c. wajim -ma- ‘wash something’ d. gadigad -(i)nya- ‘cut up something’

Loan preverbs are fully integrated into the preverb system (including the classiﬁcation system), and they do not appear to behave differently from the rest of the Bardi preverb lexicon. The loans do, however, appear to be concentrated towards a particular conﬁguration of complex predicate, where the preverb assigns the semantic roles in the predicate, and the verb appears to be there to support agreement morphology. We do not ﬁnd loans in reinforcing, pseudo-incorporated, or idiomatic complex predicates.
Finally, I have one example where a Kriol complex verb phrase is used as a preverb. The text comes from a story told by Nancy Isaac in 2001:

(13.60) Shopping do’im ingarramana.
Shopping do’im i-ng-arr-a-ma-na. shopping do 3-PST-AUG-TR-put-REM.PST

‘They were going shopping.’

(NI: CB10)

7. Typology of complex predicates
In the following subsections I present the types of complex predicate structures found in Bardi. Although complex predicates in Nyulnyulan have been characterized as a ‘classiﬁcatory’ type of construction, not all complex predicates behave in this way. Four relationships between the preverb and the ‘light verb’ can be identiﬁed. These are given in §§13.7.1–13.7.4.

Typology of complex predicates 529
7.1. Preverb = inﬂecting verb
One type of complex predicate involves the preverb restricting the meaning of the inﬂecting verb. In such cases, the verb is never one of the light verbs also used in classiﬁcation (although the preverb may be used with other inﬂecting verbs as well). The preverb is frequently an adverb, or it may have the same or very similar meaning to the inﬂecting verb. Examples (13.61) to (13.64) give some common examples of the verbs used with this type of preverb construction:
(13.61) verbs of speech: a. balygarr -nganka- ‘swear’; cf. balygarr ‘swearing’, -nganka‘speak’ b. balygarr -garnboo- ‘swear at someone’; cf. balygarr ‘swearing’, -garnboo- ‘scold someone’
(13.62) verbs of motion: a. darr(al) ∼ dorrol -booloo- ‘come out’; cf. -booloo- ‘come’ b. joodarrarr -galala- ‘go with the tide’ (cf. joodarrarr ‘in the direction of tidal motion’, -galala- ‘move’ (reduplicated form of -gala- ‘move, visit, live’) c. joornk -jarrala- ‘run’ (cf. joornk ‘run (n, adv)’, -jarrala- ‘run’) d. wirr -jarrmi- ‘rise, get up’ (cf. -jarrmi- ‘get up’)
(13.63) other: a. gooroogooroo -boolmoo- ‘smell nice’ (cf. gooroogooroo ‘smell (n)’ -boolmoo- ‘smell (v)’) b. lagal -ganyi- ‘climb’
(13.64) ‘adverbial’: a. goolgarr -gama- ‘laugh’ (cf. -gama- ‘laugh’) b. ngaada -joogooloo- ‘break in half’ (cf. ngaada ‘short’, -joogooloo- ‘break’) c. jondol -moolgoo- ‘sleep doubled up’ (cf. jondol ‘doubled up’, -moolgoo- ‘lie asleep’) d. anyja -mooroo- ‘give away’ (cf. anyja ‘away, off’ (also a noun meaning ‘gift’, as well as an adverb), -mooroo- ‘waste, throw away’)

530 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
Where the preverb is a ‘dynamic’ noun (more ‘verblike’, e.g. goolgarr ‘laughing’) there is never mismatch in valency between the preverb and the light verb. Also, although the preverbs with adverbial readings do satisfy the tests for complex predicate status (appearance inside negation, for example: see §13.2.5 above), it is not clear that they are making a contribution to the argument structure of the verb phrase.
Where the preverb seems to do nothing to the argument structure of the light verb, I assume vacuous transfer of the preverb’s arguments to the light verb. That is, the preverb still transfers its arguments, but because we get the same result that we would have obtained had there been no argument transfer. The semantics and argument structure of the resulting predicate is the same as that of the components.
Complex predicates with adverbial preverbs do not seem to involve argument transfer; the reading is strictly compositional. This would be expected, as adverbs (e.g. the manner adverbs which are the bulk of the adverbs used in complex predicates in Bardi) do not subcategorize for arguments, so there are no thematic indices to transfer.
7.2. Pseudo-incorporation
The second type of complex predicate is one in which the preverb appears to be functioning as a pseudo-incorporated object, or occasionally as an instrument.186 The predicate as a whole is intransitive.
(13.65) a. ngaanka -gonboo- ‘send a message’ (ngaanka = ‘word, language’, -gonboo- = ‘send’)
b. ngaanka -ma- ‘make a plan’ (-ma- = ‘put’)
(13.66) gooljoo -janboo- ‘pull out grass’ (gooljoo = ‘grass’, -janboo- = ‘tread on’)
Unlike the examples in §13.7.1, however, these verbs do not appear to form a cohesive class with distinct syntactic properties, and it is not clear that these should be analyzed as cases of non-productive pseudo-incorporation. Perhaps the cases where the ‘light verb’ is not usually a light verb could be analyzed this way.
There are a few recorded cases of verbal alternations between pseudoincorporated objects and ‘real’ objects. Compare the following:

Typology of complex predicates 531

(13.67)

a. Gooljoo angarranboojirr mayala.

Gooljoo a-ng-arr-anboo=jirr

mayala.

grass 1-PST-AUG-TR-step.on=3AUG.IO spinifex

‘We pulled out the spinifex grass’ [after loosening up the ground with a rock].

b. Angarranboogaljirr mayala gooljoo.

A-ng-arr-anboo-gal=jirr

mayala gooljoo.

1-PST-AUG-TR-step.on=3AUG.IO spinifex grass

(Aklif 1999:-janboo-)

In sentence (a) the generic noun gooljoo ‘grass’ is functioning as a preverb. In the (b) sentence it appears as part of the object mayala gooljoo ‘spinifex grass’.187
We cannot, however, use the pseudo-incorporation analysis for complex predicates more generally. There are complex predicates which look very similar to the ones just described in (13.65), except that they have the wrong valency; they are transitive rather than intransitive. Thus the preverb, which would be analyzed as a pseudo-incorporated ‘object’, is not the only ‘object’ of the clause. One illustration is given in (13.68):

(13.68) Aambanim boor inamboogaljin goorlil.

Aamba-nim boor i-na-m-boo-gal=jin

goorlil.

man-ERG ‘ground’ 3-TR-PST-poke-REC.PST=3M.IO turtle.

‘The man missed the turtle.’

This example means what the English translation implies; it does not mean that the man speared the ground instead of the turtle, for example. This type of pseudo-incorporation usually occurs with the light verb classiﬁers, so it is treated under the typology of classiﬁcation in §13.9 below. If we assume a pseudo-incorporation analysis for the structures in (13.65) and (13.67), however, we have a source for the creation of clauses like those in (13.68). We would simply have to assume that a pseudo-incorporated structure was reanalyzed as a classiﬁcatory complex predicate, which could take a direct object. The process I assume is something like this. In the ﬁrst place we would have a transitive sentence with a full (not ‘light’) verb alternating with a pseudo-incorporated sentence. Perhaps the pseudo-incorporated sentence was idiomatic for ‘he missed’ (e.g. he speared the ground instead of a kangaroo).

532 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

(13.69)

a. Aambanim inamboogal boor.

Aamba-nim i-na-m-boo-gal

boor.

man-ERG 3-TR-PST-spear-REC.PST ground

‘The man speared the ground.’

b. Aamba [boor inamboogal]. Aamba [boor i-na-m-boo-gal]. man-ERG ground 3-TR-PST-spear-REC.PST

‘The man ground-speared.’ i.e. ‘he missed’ (intrans)

Now, suppose that (13.69b) were reanalyzed as comprising the light verb -boo- rather than the full verb. It would have the same structure as an unergative complex predicate and could participate in the same transitive/intransitive alternations that other verbs (such as ‘eat’) do.

7.3. Classiﬁcation
The third type of complex predicate is the most common in Bardi. Here the light verb functions as an event classiﬁer and/or a licenser of various arguments. These are the topic of §13.9, and are summarized in Table 13.2. They are thus not discussed further here but are mentioned in the typology for completeness.

7.4. Idioms
Finally, there are the idioms which do not ﬁt these patterns. Many could probably be subsumed under other categories, or we could treat them as another instance of the construction, different from the classiﬁcation or pseudoincorporation cases.
(13.70) joowara -jardi- ‘sneak away together’ (-jardi- ‘ask permission’)
In these idiomatic constructions, the light verb and full verb use are hard to relate to one another semantically, and the preverb is usually underived and has no uses in other word classes.

The adicity problem 533

8. The adicity problem

Bardi complex predicates present a problem that does not seem to occur in analyses of complex predicates in other Northern Australian languages (apart from possibly Jaminjung (Schultze-Berndt 2000), for which see below).188 This problem involves the use of a bivalent light verb in an intransitive predicate. The verb is inﬂected for the ‘transitive’ preﬁx n- ∼ a-, but not enough arguments surface in the clause. An example is given in (13.71).

(13.71) Majoonggooloo roowil innyagal barda.

Majoonggooloo roowil i-n-nya-gal

barda.

young.girl

walk 3-TR-catch-REC.PST away.

‘The young girl walked off.’

Here the light verb is -(i)nya- ‘catch’, a bivalent light verb which shows the transitive minimal preﬁx n-. The predicate is intransitive, however. There is a single argument (majoonggooloo ‘young girl’), and it appears in the absolutive case. It is not possible to introduce an ergative-marked argument into the clause. It thus appears that the light verb is introducing an argument into the clause which is never realized; this should render the predicate ungrammatical, but such predicates are not only licit, but quite common.
There are several possible analyses. One is to argue simply that the preﬁx n- ∼ a- is required for morphological completeness. We would argue that the verb -(i)nya- belongs to the class of verbs which requires this preﬁx, and the stem would not be well-formed without it (just as, for example, ﬁrst conjugation verbs in Latin require a thematic vowel -a, while second conjugation verbs take -e). That is, we could treat the preﬁx as a conjugation marker, which happens to correlate well with transitivity. However, there is ample evidence from non-light verbs that the ‘transitive’ morpheme does, indeed, mark verbs as transitive; it is not an arbitrary marker in the verb preﬁx system when we consider non-light verbs.
A second reason why the presence of n- ∼ a- might not be a problem is that we notice from other languages that adicity in the root is not necessarily preserved in complex predicate constructions. In Japanese, for example, the number of arguments to surface depends on the preverbal noun, not the light verb suru ‘do’ (Grimshaw and Mester 1988). However, languages like Japanese have no overt marking for transitivity in the verb phrase; moreover,

534 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
in Bardi complex predicates, it appears that the light verb does limit the number of arguments a predicate may take, at least when it comes to monovalent light verbs (discussed further below).
Under now standard analyses of non-conﬁgurational languages in generative grammar (e.g. Baker 1996, Jelinek 1984, pace Austin 2001, Austin and Bresnan 1996), in nonconﬁgurational languages with complex agreement, it is the agreement marking on the verb which fulﬁlls the argument structure of the verb. In Bardi, the presence of object agreement clitics is licensed by the presence of the transitivity preﬁx n- ∼ a-. Now, if in a complex predicate, the predicate is intransitive while the verb shows transitive morphology, as long as some version of the pronominal argument hypothesis holds, the verb is projecting an argument and a semantic role which is not ﬁlled. This should be ungrammatical.189
McGregor’s (2002) solution to the presence of the transitivity marker is that such verbs are avalent; that is, there is no speciﬁcation of valency by the n- ∼ a- morpheme (licensed by the root). Instead, the valency of the complex predicate is determined by the preverb. We are left, however, with the problem of why avalency should only show up in complex predicates; otherwise there is an almost absolute correlation between the presence of n- ∼ aand transitive simple predicates.190 Remember also that McGregor does not treat ‘light verbs’ differently from full lexical verbs; his explanation does not capture the different behavior for the two verb types. Moreover, if light verbs are avalent, it is difﬁcult to explain why monovalent light verbs systematically form unaccusative complex predicates. That is, there are clear patterns in the transitivity mismatches in complex predicates, with bivalent light verbs allowing either intransitive or transitive complex predicates, but monovalent light verbs allow only intransitive complex predicates.
Another option would be to argue that bivalent light verbs are polysemous: that is, they have multiple possibilities for argument assignment and therefore have multiple lexical entries. Different light verbs would then select different lexical entries for their light verb. If this is correct, however, then why would it only be bivalent simple predicates that have the possibility for two lexical entries? Why do we not ﬁnd monovalent simple predicates with equivalent multiple lexical entries?
Schultze-Berndt (2000:180-183) discusses a similar problem for the Mirndi language Jaminjung. She analyzes ‘dummy-undergoers’ of some transitive verbs, where an extra argument does not appear although it is cross-referenced in the agreement morphology. Her solution is to posit dummy agreement.

Semantics of event classiﬁcation 535

That is, the agreement slot is morphologically required, but is ‘empty’ of reference in the same way that the expletive it in English sentences such as ‘it’s raining’ are empty.

(13.72) Jaminjung:

Ngayin=malang bul gani-ma

bunyag.

meat.animal=GIVEN emerge 3SG:3SG-HIT.PST 3dl.OBL

‘The animal came out to/for the two.’ (Schultze-Berndt 2000:181)

In this sentence the preﬁx chunk is transitive, marking a third person singular subject acting on a third person singular object. The preverb bul ‘emerge’, however, licenses only one argument. (The oblique pronoun bunyag is not cross-referenced by the verb.) This is represented in Schultze-Berndt’s framework as dummy agreement, unlinked to other parts of the structure. Such a solution is problematic, however, since it would appear to be unable to rule out other cases where an unlinked object agreement afﬁx would be ungrammatical.

9. Semantics of event classiﬁcation
In this section I describe in detail the contribution that light verbs in complex predicate constructions make to the semantics of the predicate. The Bardi system is rather messy, even in the areas where we can identify event classiﬁers. There are many local patterns, but a precise statement that ‘form X marks meaning Y’ is impossible. Moreover, event classiﬁcation is not the only function of light verbs in complex predicates.

9.1. Previous work
Since I have claimed that Bardi light verbs make a contribution to the semantics of the clause and are not semantically empty, in this section I will discuss the meanings of the light verbs within a classiﬁcation system. I follow work of McGregor (2002) and Schultze-Berndt (2000) explicitly in making this claim, and many other writers of grammars of North Australian languages implicitly. There are two previous published discussions of Bardi complex predication: Nicolas (2000) and before that, Metcalfe (1975b). My analysis differs from each in some respects, and so they are discussed brieﬂy here.

536 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

9.1.1. Nicolas (1998, 2000)

The ﬁrst analysis of Nyulnyulan languages as having a verb classiﬁcation system is due, to my knowledge, to an unpublished paper by McGregor (McGregor 1991). Nicolas (1998) analyzes Bardi in this way (without discussion of other Nyulnyulan languages), and a summary is published as Nicolas (2000). Under her analysis, the inﬂecting verb acts as a classiﬁer of the preverb, indicating the type of event the preverb refers to. Nicolas (2000) proposes that Bardi’s preverbs are classiﬁed by lexical valency, aspect, and trajectory. This gives us an idea of the type of meaning that the inﬂecting verb brings to the complex predicate. For example, -ar- ‘spear lice’ is used with actions which occur around a point and have a deﬁned trajectory:

(13.73)

a. dirray -ar- ‘rotate something’ b. jiin -ar- ‘point at something’ c. jibiny -ar- ‘thrust a spear’ d. joorr -ar- ‘drip’ e. janngal -ar- ‘cut across the tide’

Unfortunately, many of the statements in Nicolas (2000) are incorrect, probably because they are based on a small corpus. For example, she states (p. 160) that -jiidi- is only used to mark anti-causative constructions. This is not true; it is the primary function, but -jiidi- also forms complex predicates with a motion component, as seen in §13.9.2.2.
Nicolas is unclear on the syntactic status of preverb-inﬂecting verb construction, calling them ‘compounds’ or ‘verbes complexes’ without further elaboration as to the syntactic structure she assumes.191 Although I disagree with many of the details of Nicolas’ description of Bardi, I do agree that the inﬂecting verb in Bardi’s complex predicate construction ﬁlls the functional role of a classiﬁer and serves to mark event classiﬁcation. The source of my disagreement with Nicolas’ analysis is the very small corpus (around 400 preverbs) which she used. The arguments made in this chapter are drawn from a corpus of 975 preverbs.

9.1.2. McGregor (2002)
Unlike Nicolas (1998, 2000), McGregor (2002) argues for a particular syntactic structure underlying complex predicates in Northern Australian languages,

Semantics of event classiﬁcation 537
including Nyulnyulan languages. He argues that the classiﬁer constructions are not complex predicates. One of the reasons is because either one part or the other (or neither) of the predicate is identiﬁed as the head, not both, according to which tests are used. The criterion of inﬂectional locus identiﬁes the head as the inﬂecting verb; however, thematic role assignment (McGregor argues) usually identiﬁes the preverb as the head. McGregor’s other argument is based on transitivity alternations. Since the structure of the complex predicate does not always correspond to the morphological transitivity of the inﬂecting verb, there is a problem in saying that the two predicative units (the preverb and the inﬂecting verb) jointly determine clause structure, since the relationship is clearly not additive.
It is difﬁcult, however, to use these points to argue for a classiﬁer analysis instead of a complex predicate analysis. If we take McGregor’s line on tests for headedness, how are we to account for the data which I presented in §13.2? We would be led into arguing that an adjunct is determining subject grammatical roles! McGregor’s argument about valency mismatch invalidating the complex predicate analysis is true if one takes a strict view that syntax cannot modify argument structure, however it is unclear to me that calling the inﬂecting verb a ‘classiﬁer’ removes this problem; if the verb is a full lexical verb in such constructions we run into problems of completeness and coherence.
9.2. Monovalent light verbs
The following sections discuss the main monovalent light verbs in Bardi. I omit from discussion those light verbs which combine with only one or two preverbs; they are given in a summary section in §13.9.5 below.
For each verb I identify the types of preverbs it may combine with, characteristics of the argument structure of the predicate, and the semantics which the preverb contributes to the predicate as a whole.
All complex predicates with monovalent light verbs are intransitive. They take a single argument, which shows subject agreement, and is marked in the absolutive case.
9.2.1. Stative predicates: -ni- ‘sit’
The light verb -ni- introduces a stative reading to the predicate. Complex predicates with -ni- can have either an adjective or a noun in the locative case

538 Preverbs and Complex Predicates

as a preverb (see §13.6.7 above), such as anggoorrgoon -ni- ‘be in tears’. The preverbs which take -ni- are listed in (13.74). Adjectives are not listed since the construction is productive. Other preverbs which appear with this root are not found in other word classes.
The preverbs in (13.74) have been divided into three categories on the basis of etymology and semantics. Those in (a) are preverbs that denote that the subject is in a location, those in (b) describe position, while those in (c) describe other states.

(13.74)

a. with a locative preverb: aarlon -ni- ‘be ﬁshing’; gooron -ni‘be playing’; wiliwilon -ni- ‘ﬁshing’; rangoon -ni- ‘he lay on his stomach’; anggoorrgoon -ni- ‘be in tears’; gooron -ni- ‘play’;
b. denoting position: ilogo -ni- ‘lie on one’s side’; arlarr -ni- ‘lie on one’s back’;
c. other states: iilan -ni- ‘be sick’; miyala -ni- ‘be awake’; gorna -ni- ‘feel alright’; jambarra -ni- ‘listen’; wiinya -ni- ‘be full’ (+ other adjectives, productively); wilwil -ni- ‘breathe’; jarnin -ni‘was drifting, and came ashore on land’; woorr -ni- ‘sleep’

Adjectival preverbs which form stative predicates with -ni- ‘sit’ may also combine with the light verb -joo- ‘do/say’ to form inchoatives (cf. §13.9.4 below).

9.2.2. Anticausatives and motion: -jiidi- ‘go’
The root -jiidi- ‘go’ has two main uses in the light verb system. It does not seem to combine with adjectives. The ﬁrst use is related to the non-light meaning of -jiidi-, that is, ‘go’. Some complex predicates involving -jiidiretain this meaning of motion, e.g. in (13.75).
(13.75) galgooriny -jiidi- ‘swim’
The second use of -jiidi- is as a marker of anticausatives (that is, the intransitive predicate derived from an underlyingly ‘causative,’ transitive predicate). Preverbs which take -(i)nya- ‘catch’ as their transitive light verb have an intransitive anticausative (unaccusative) counterpart formed with -jiidi-, as in (13.76):
(13.76) a. lolor -jiidi- v.it ‘peel off’ (x-ABS peels off);

Semantics of event classiﬁcation 539

b. lolor -(i)nya- v.tr ‘peel off’ (y-ERG peels x-ABS off)

Other anticausatives in -jiidi- have transitive counterparts in -ø- or -ma-. Some examples are given in (13.77) below:

(13.77) (13.78)

a. boornd(oo) -jiidi- v.it ‘close’ (x-ABS closes); b. boornd(oo) -ma- v.tr ‘close’ (y-ERG closes x-ABS) a. doolool -jiidi- v.it ‘roll down (x-ABS rolls); b. doolool -ma- v.tr ‘pour down (y-ERG pours x-ABS down);

(13.79) gives the forms with unaccusative resultatives, while (13.80) lists the light verbs with a motion meaning.

(13.79)

Unaccusative anticausatives: boorndoo -jiidi- ‘close’; doolool -jiidi- ‘pour, roll down (of water)’; doomal -jiidi- ‘light up and ﬂash around’; lolor -jiidi- ‘peel off’; gagal -jiidi- ‘split in two’; lalala -jiidi- ‘be split’; irribirrib -jiidi- ‘collapse’; roogood -jiidi- ‘come off’; lambard -jiidi- ‘be open’; roogooroog -jiidi- ‘get worn out’; daldal -jiidi- ‘develop dry, cracked skin’; diyil -jiidi- ‘burst’; lol -jiidi- ‘catch ﬁre’; doolool -jiidi- ‘come out quickly, be poured out’; dirldirl -jiidi- ‘break out in spots’; dooboo -jiidi- ‘make a smoke signal, rise from a kindled ﬁre (of smoke)’; boorndoo -jiidi- ‘close’; manmarr -jiidi- ‘get a fright’; marrmarr -jiidi- ‘be afraid’; boorrooboorr -jiidi- ‘swell up’

(13.80) Motion verbs: joorroorr -jiidi- ‘come in (of tide)’; dooly -jiidi‘dump (of waves)’; galgooriny -jiidi- ‘swim’

9.2.3. Reciprocal: -banji- ‘share, exchange’
Another example of a light verb with fairly clear semantics is -banji- ‘exchange’, which is used with reciprocal actions. (13.81) gives an illustration of three such preverbs, although the use of -banji- is fairly productive (as was discussed in §12.3.6 above) and many examples can be found in the Bardi dictionary.
(13.81) a. baad -banji- ‘wrestle’ b. banggili -banji- ‘paint one another’

540 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
c. loorrbloorrb -banji- ‘argue with each other’
All these preverbs are also recorded with other light verbs in non-reﬂexive meanings. baad is recorded with -ø- in the meaning ‘grab onto something’, banggil also takes -ma- in the meaning ‘daub on paint for a ceremonial purpose’ and loorrbloorrb can take either -ga- ‘carry’ or -ma- ‘put’.
9.2.4. -ganyi- ‘climb’
The light verb -ganyi- has a non-light counterpart meaning ‘climb’ in other Nyulnyulan languages, although in the modern language it is found only with preverbs.192 Five preverbs can be used with -ganyi-:
(13.82) angan -ganyi- ‘come closer’; binbirr -ganyi- ‘drift to a place’; birrbard -ganyi- ‘ricochet, bounce back’; boorrooboorr -ganyi- ‘swell up’; lagal -ganyi- ‘climb’
Of these, only the last, lagal+, is common. Several appear only in the Metcalfe dictionary and are not known to current speakers. Boorrooboorr+ ‘swell up’ is also recorded with -jiidi- in the same meaning.
9.2.5. -gardi- ‘enter, go inside’
The four preverbs which combine with -gardi- ‘enter’ all involve meanings associated with ‘entering’ something (if ‘dive’ is taken as decomposing semantically into ‘entering’ water). Note that unlike English ‘enter’, Bardi -gardi- is only monovalent.
(13.83) gardin -gardi- ‘enter’; oorlil -gardi- ‘dive’; lool -gardi- ‘enter’; joomboor -gardi- ‘pull in, go in’
It is not entirely clear whether -gardi- should be treated as a true ‘light verb’ in the sense of Grimshaw and Mester (1988) and Jespersen (1954/1909), even though phrases such as lool -gardi- ‘enter’ behave as complex predicates. Most likely, we can analyze -gardi- as a light verb which introduces an event variable involving trajectory. Such light verbs are found in Turkic languages (cf. Bowern 2004c, Schamiloglu 1996).

Semantics of event classiﬁcation 541

9.2.6. Undirected motion: -gala- ‘visit, move, live’

The non-light counterpart of -gal(a)- ‘move, visit, live’ is unusual amongst Bardi verbs in that it is the only apparently ambitransitive verb which does not reﬂect its two frames by a change in morphology. The root always takes transitive morphology, though the case array of the arguments which appear with the verb can differ (either ergative/absolutive in bivalent uses, or absolutive only in monovalent ones). This is illustrated in (13.84).

(13.84)

a. Marbiddynim inanggalajarrngay bardi.

(Transitive)

Marbiddy-nim i-na-ng-gala=jarrngay

bardi.

M.-ERG

3-TR-PST-gala=1MIN.FOC.DO yesterday.

‘Marbiddy visited me yesterday.’

‘Layoord spirits live in the scrub.’

c. Nyirroogoordoo minkal?

Nyirroogoordoo mi-n-kal?

how-PROP

2-TR-‘wander’

‘How are you?’

The morphology of -gal(a)- is also highly irregular. Aklif’s notes suggest there are two roots, -gali- and -gal- or -gala-. I only found evidence for one root, and I treat the variation in ﬁnal vowel (a ∼ ø ∼ i) as conditioned by the following sufﬁx. In case I am wrong, however, I have not standardized the citation forms in the dictionary or in (13.85) below.
The verb -gala- ‘visit, move, live’ is the only morphologically bivalent root to enter only into intransitive complex predicates, so it is discussed here with monovalent roots (which by deﬁnition produce intransitive complex predicates) rather than with the bivalent light verbs, which otherwise produce either only transitive predicates or both transitive and intransitive ones.
(13.85) gives the preverbs which have been recorded with -gala- or its reduplicated form -galala-. Note from this that -gala- is also an exception to the rule that most light verbs no longer admit a light verb reading when they are reduplicated (cf. -banji- in §13.9.2.3 and §13.5 above).

542 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
(13.85) a. Motion: arrgaly -gala- ‘slip, fall over’; darda -gala- ‘drip’; jarrmarn -gal- ‘wade, cut across, interrupt’; woo -gala- ‘dive down’; diwirrdiwirr -gala- ‘stagger’; yoor -gala- ‘slip’
b. ‘Flashing’: bilybily -gal- ‘skip across the water’; jidily -gala‘jump (of sparks from exploding coals)’; dilydily -gala- ‘sparkle, ﬂash (of waves, ﬁre-light)’
c. Activities: moorrgoolon -gal- ‘work’; aarlon -gal- ‘ﬁsh, go ﬁshing’; gooron -gal- ‘play’; wiily -gala- ‘scream’
d. Other: galgal -gal- ‘be tired and aching’; gir -gal- ‘live, reside, stay for some time, be settled down’; gorna -gal- ‘be well’; irrgididi -gal- ‘be giddy’; goondoorr -gal- ‘get giddy and die’; lidi -gala- ‘become dry’
(13.86) with reduplication: -galalaa. Motion: joodarrarr -galala- ‘go with the tide’; b. Other: irrgidid -galagal- ‘be giddy’; gorna -galala- ‘become physically well developed’
In Nyulnyul, complex predicates taking -kal- (the cognate of Bardi -gala-) describe actions which are non-volitional (or uncontrolled) or have a lack of deﬁned trajectory. Some preverbs in Bardi which take -gal(a)- show this too, such as irrgidid+ ‘(be) giddy’193 and diwirrdiwirr+ ‘stagger’. Others, such as goron+ ‘play’ and joodarrarr+ ‘in the direction of the tide’, would appear to be evidence for undirected motion. It is difﬁcult to see, however, how wiily+ ‘scream’ or gorna+ ‘good’ ﬁt into this pattern.
9.3. Bivalent light verbs
Bivalent light verbs are more common in Bardi than monovalent ones. Bivalent light verbs (apart from -gal(a)-, discussed above) form both transitive and intransitive complex predicates. Many of the resulting intransitive complex predicates are unergative, although not all are.
9.3.1. Resultative: -ma- ‘put’
The root -ma- ‘put’ has many uses in Bardi. It is used productively with adjectives to form causatives, in the frame ‘make X adj’. An illustration is given

Semantics of event classiﬁcation 543

in (13.87). All adjectives may combine with -ma- in this meaning.

(13.87) joorrong inamana ‘he straightened it’ (joorroong(g) ‘straight’, -ma‘put’)

In a closely related use of -ma-, the preverb is a process and the whole predicate indicates a causative result.

(13.88) a. wajim -ma- ‘to clean’ b. liyan alig -ma- ‘to make someone angry’

Almost all transitive complex predicates with -ma- are resultative. The only possible exception is nganngan -ma- ‘have a conversation’, which does not seem to be resultative (although this may be an artifact of translation).

‘Talk to me! How come I am talking to you without you answering me?’

Many verbs with -ma- involve a sense of impact, although the effect is indirect (that is, the impact is mediated through a source). Another common theme of the transitive -ma- predicates is the idea of collection, and metaphorically putting objects in a particular place. jaala+ ‘string ﬁsh on a spear’ is one example.

g. Other resultatives: boorroolboorrool -ma- ‘boil’; jilarli -ma‘bring to point of death’; jililjilil -ma- ‘rock’; joorrbara -ma‘stretch out ﬁrmly, especially limbs’; lanybal -ma- ‘make level, smooth’; -moonggoon ma- ‘teach’; wajim -ma- ‘wash’; waloong -ma- ‘take care’

h. Other: arnkoorr -ma- ‘gather’; balirn -ma- ‘take care, keep’; barnbi -ma- ‘shift something’; biidi -ma- ‘bury something’; boojoom -ma- ‘push off’; goombil -ma- ‘paint’; jalyimbidi -ma‘twist’; janin -ma- ‘land’; liyan -ma- ‘want’; maramar -ma‘put legs apart’; mirrnan -ma- ‘save up’; ngarrarda -ma‘show’; ninil -ma- ‘not to be touched, leave it alone’; ooly -ma‘rain’
Causatives, with deadjectival preverbs: abarrabarr -ma- ‘be careless with, hold someone up’; boondoo -ma- ‘shut, close’; boordaboorda -ma- ‘get things ready, repair, adjust’; born(k)ony -ma- ‘turn over’; bornkony -ma- ‘turn something over’; diidid -ma- ‘make it curly’; diimba -ma- ‘join, tie something together’; diiwa -ma‘make hard’; diyildiyil -ma- ‘perforate’; garrja -ma- ‘sharpen’; garrjagarrja -ma- ‘sharpen’; garrya -ma- ‘sharpen’; giiny(i) -ma- ‘shut something’; giinyji -ma- ‘obstruct, block’; goojaji -ma- ‘make someone weak, wear someone out’; gorna -ma- ‘clean’; gorngorn -ma‘build something, make it good’; ilil -ma- ‘ﬂatten’; jaardoo -ma‘curve, bend’; jardoo -ma- ‘bend’; joorroong -ma- ‘straighten’; jorndorndola -ma- ‘coil’; layib -ma- ‘relieve, make better’; loogal -ma- ‘lose a person’

Many of the complex predicates which are cognate with Nyulnyul and which in that language use -ga- ‘carry’ as the light verb appear in Bardi with -ma-. It is thus most likely that the Bardi forms represent a conﬂation of two distinct light verb uses in earlier Nyulnyulan.
The intransitive predicates, however, are much more difﬁcult to categorize. The most notable feature they share is that they are all unergative.

(13.92)

Intransitive:
a. Motion: jibad -ma- ‘sneak up’; oorroorr -ma- ‘sit down’; gaana -ma- ‘drift in with the tide’; rawin -ma- ‘go as a group’; rayi -ma- ‘come around’; yoorr -ma- ‘coming down’
b. Activities: banggil -ma- ‘daub on paint for a ceremonial purpose’; barn -ma- ‘do something’; dirdoorrdirdoorr -ma‘dance’; jagaljagal -ma- ‘cut steps into a tree’; oondoog -ma‘go moonlight ﬁshing’;
c. Speech and thought acts: loorrb -ma- ‘argue, quarrel, scold’; loorrbaloorrba -ma- ‘speak heatedly together’; ningarrarda

546 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
-ma- (+ IO) ‘believe’; war -ma- ‘bark’;
d. Body functions: ngoondoo -ma- ‘urinate’; oona -ma- ‘defecate’;
e. Other +ga -ma- ‘rest’; boondi -ma- ‘cloud over’; jondol -ma‘double up one’s legs’; malbarn -ma- ‘be busy’; marrbal -ma‘signal’; niya -ma- ‘rest’; rarrjin -ma- ‘get shame’;
It is possible that two verbs of the form -ma- have been conﬂated into a single paradigm in Bardi’s history. In Nyikina, -ma- has both transitive and intransitive forms. The intransitive form means ‘say’. However, there are also monovalent verbs of the same form in Karajarri and Mangarla, which are Pama-Nyungan languages from the Marrngu subgroup, with which Nyikina is in close contact. It is possible that Nyikina has calqued the intransitive uses from those languages, since it is, to my knowledge, the only Nyulnyulan language to show an intransitive root -ma-.

9.3.2. -bi- ‘hit with implement’

The verb -bi- is found only in Bardi, to my knowledge, and other Nyulnyulan languages do not seem to make a distinction between ‘hit with hand’ and ‘hit with an instrument’. The fact that the verb roots in Bardi are -bi- ‘hit with object’194 and -boo- ‘hit with hand’ may make one suspicious that either the distinction is not a real one, or that the category is a recent innovation (or there may be dialect borrowing involved). The distinction is a real one, however.
The preverbs which take -bi- are given in (13.93a) and (13.93b). Many of the predicates would seem to contain some idea of impact, or could be contrived in such a way metaphorically.

(13.93)

a. Transitive: dool -bi- ‘smash open’; doodool -bi- ‘smash’; dida -bi- ‘make a noise’; jooroorr -bi- ‘poke something into a hole’; roong -bi- ‘swallow, suck back in’; garr -bi- ‘rub to stop pain’; roorrb -bi- ‘overtake someone while walking, beat someone at doing something’
b. Intransitive: gird -bi- ‘boil up on someone’; nod -bi- ‘make the sound of water’

Semantics of event classiﬁcation 547

9.3.3. -boo- ‘hit, poke, kill’

In non-light use, -boo- means ‘hit, poke, or kill’ something. Most of the transitive uses of -boo- in light verb constructions involve impact. The preverbs which take -boo- are given in (13.94):

(13.94)

a. Transitive: boor -boo- ‘miss’; gorr -boo- ‘receive, collect, especially in gambling games’; jamool -boo- ‘wound an animal and let it get away’; joodoo -boo- ‘hit with a spear’; joongoorr -boo- ‘poke’; larrara -boo- ‘wound’; milimili -boo- ‘write down’; nyinyingan -boo- ‘dodge’
b. Intransitive: marr -boo- ‘bloom’; moorroomoondool -boo‘bloom’; ngamarna -boo- ‘breast-feed’; rinyi -boo- ‘think’; wii -boo- ‘spurt out’

9.3.4. -ga- ‘carry’

The place of -ga- ‘carry’ within the system of light verbs in Bardi is odd. On the one hand, -ga- is clearly reconstructible to Proto-Nyulnyulan as a light verb and we can reconstruct a number of preverbs which take it. On the other hand, -ga- is considerably less important in the Bardi light verb system than it is in many other Nyulnyulan languages. One of the differences between Nyulnyul and Bardi, for example, is the relative importance of -ga- (Nyulnyul -k-) in the two languages. In many Nyulnyulan languages -ma- and -ga- have approximately the same frequency. In Bardi, however, -ma- is much more common, and many verbs which take -k- in Nyulnyul take -ma- in Bardi.

(13.95)

Transitive:
a. Preverbs involving ‘carrying’: abarrabarr -ga- ‘lead astray’; bard(a) -ga- ‘take across’; boor -ga- ‘take someone around’; jarrbad -ga- ‘lift’; joorroorl -ga- ‘carry around’; moondoo -ga‘carry’; waj -ga- ‘take away’; yawoorr -ga- ‘pull’
b. Motion: gaana -ga- ‘drift in with the tide’; goodilgoodil -ga‘going this way and that’; noolgoo -ga- ‘drift away’; rirr -ga‘go behind’; rooj -ga- ‘pass’
c. Speech acts: jarrman -ga- ‘interrupt’; jiido -ga- ‘bother someone’; jininingan -ga- ‘mock: he mocked us’; loorrb -ga- ‘argue,

Intransitive: ngalgan -ga- ‘wag (of tail)’; oongooloo -ga- ‘be with child’

9.3.5. -ar- ‘spear (lice), pierce’

Proto-Nyulnyulan *-ra- probably meant ‘spear’, in a fairly general sense. This is the meaning, for example, in Nyikina and the other Eastern Nyulnyulan languages. In Bardi, however, the cognate root -ar- has been narrowed in meaning, and now means ‘spear lice’.195 In Nyulnyul, as well as in the earlier sources for Bardi, the word seems also to have meant ‘sew’.
The complex predicates given in the following examples:

(13.97)

Transitive: boorroolboorrool -ar- ‘boil’; dirray -ar- ‘turn something around’; gilygily -ar- ‘tickle’; goodil -ar- ‘turn’; goonoogoon -ar- ‘push something right in’; jardinkool -ar- ‘block’; jarr -ar‘ﬂow, leak, drip through a hole’; jibiny -ar- ‘thrust a spear’; jiin -ar- ‘point at’; joodoog -ar- ‘kick, stumble’; joorr -ar- ‘drip, ﬂow’; mibad -ar- ‘tie up’; niimi -ar- ‘string (beads or shells)’; noondin -ar- ‘walk across’; oorr -ar- ‘put into’

(13.98) Intransitive:

a. bodily functions: bilirl -ar- ‘yawn’; girringg -ar- ‘cough’; girringgirringgi -ar- ‘cough up phlegm, expectorate’; jilmboonggoorr -ar- ‘sneeze’; nyoonyi -ar- ‘blow nose’

b. motion: darr -ar- ‘come’; dirrb -ar- ‘dive into the water’; janngal -ar- ‘cut across the tide’

c. other: jilyjily -ar- ‘dripping of water’; jirrijirr -ar- ‘little bit of rain; it’s sprinkling a bit’; jinbarr -ar- ‘be split’; dooly or jool -ar- ‘kneel’; milimili -ar- ‘write’ ooly -ar- ‘rain’

Most of the preverbs contain an idea of deﬁned trajectory, piercing, or action around a designated point. Body functions involving expectoration also take -ar-.

Semantics of event classiﬁcation 549

9.3.6. -ø- ‘give’

The verb ‘give’ in Bardi has two characteristics which make it seem exotic. First is that it obligatorily encodes only two arguments, not three. Like other verbs which are usually ditransitive, in Bardi they appear to be transitive. -ø- ‘give’ does not obligatorily encode both the theme and the recipient, and when both do appear, agreement is only with the recipient, which is marked as a direct object.
The second oddity about this verb is that the root is phonologically null. It can be reconstructed to Proto-Nyulnyulan as *-wa-, and still appears as such in the other Western Nyulnyulan languages. Compare, for example, JabirrJabirr inawan ‘he gave’, and Nyulnyul mawan ‘to give’. Proto-Nyulnyulan *w regularly becomes ø intervocalically in Bardi.
In Nyulnyul, the cognate verb -w- primarily marks actions which involve physical contact via an intermediary (something noted above for the Bardi verb -ma-).
All complex predicates with -ø- ‘give’ are accomplishments or telic activities.

(13.99)

Transitive:
a. Water: joonbool -ø- ‘soak, dip’; ngoorrngoorr -ø- ‘drown, immerse in water’
b. Spreading out: oogool -ø- ‘scatter bait’; yalyal -ø- ‘spread out’

9.3.7. -(i)nya- ‘catch, pick up’
Many verbs involving cutting and scooping take -(i)nya- as their inﬂecting verb. Complex predicates with -(i)nya- are mostly (in Vendler’s terms) accomplishments. Nicolas (2000:165-67) argues that -(i)nya- classiﬁes according to an ‘outward/upward’ feature, that is, actions which involve actual or metaphoric motion upward, non-straight motion (e.g. roowil -(i)nya‘walk’) or a process which extends over an area. I have included a category of metaphorical ‘outward’ action.
An interesting complex predicate is laanybi -(i)nya- ‘steal’. The independent word laanybi means something like ‘thieving’; it is not recorded as a separate lexical item, only with the -iid(i) nominal derivational sufﬁx which attaches to nouns and translates as ‘expert at’ (see §5.1.3 above). Thus a laanybiid is a ‘thief’, or someone expert at thieving. laanybi is therefore not an incorporated object in this complex predicate.

9.4. -joo- ‘do/say’

The verb root -joo- ∼-di- ‘do/say’ is the default light verb. It is the most common verb, accounting for about 40% of all complex predicates in the lexicon. There are more than 200 preverbs recorded with -joo- (in addition to those productively formed from adjectives), and in the interests of completeness I have listed them here. As with the other light verbs, I have divided them into categories according to the relationship between the preverb and the light verb, and the semantic classes that seem to fall out from the data.
A note is warranted about the glossing of -joo-. I have used the gloss ‘do/say’ throughout this work, following Aklif (1999) and others who have worked on Nyulnyulan languages. However, the primary meaning of -joowhen not in a light verb is ‘say’, rather than ‘do’. I have only one good example of a case where a form of -joo- clearly means ‘do’ or ‘happen’ rather than ‘say’. The relevant portion of the text is given below in (13.104); the verb is in (13.104c). The context of the story is that a group of people have been traveling in a small boat, and the engine has failed in the middle of a strong tidal current. The boat is being tossed in the current and is in danger of being swamped.

(13.105) gives the intransitive predicates. The most common intransitive predicates are resultatives formed with adjectives, as listed in (13.105a). There are, however, other intransitive predicates which also have a resultative meaning, and other intransitive predicates with -joo- ‘do/say’, which do not have a resultative meaning. The speech verbs fall into this category, for example.

way -joo- ‘call to, beckon’; wiidi -joo- ‘extinguish’; wiij -joo‘whip’; win -joo- ‘coax’; wini -joo- ‘respect’; wirr -joo- ‘scrape’; woorr -joo- ‘scrub’
The root -joo- is used by younger speakers (that is, those in their early 60s) in place of some of the other classiﬁcatory light verbs. There is, it appears that they are losing aspects of the classiﬁcation system (or some of the idiosyncratic preverb–light verb combinations) and generalizing the most common light verb, using it as a default light verb.
9.5. Other complex predicates
The ﬁnal set of complex predicates involves unproductive preverb-light verb combinations, where an inﬂecting verb combines with a single preverb. For example, there is one instance of a complex predicate with -arndi- ‘catch’, namely joomoonoonoo -arndi-, an intransitive predicate meaning ‘to gamble’. The non-productive complex predicates were given in §9.6 and Table 9.5 above.
These non-productive light verbs can be subsumed under other analyses, either pseudo-incorporation, idioms, or adverbial incorporation. Goolgarr -gama- was discussed in §13.7.1 above, for example, where it was shown that the argument structure of the preverb could be vacuously transfered to the ‘light’ verb. Doolii -jalgoo- ‘be born prematurely’ is literally ‘fall early’ and is probably a case of adverb incorporation. Finally, niimi -ngooloo- ‘keep watch’ is literally ‘throw [one’s] eye’, recalling the English idiom ‘cast one’s eye about’, and could be analyzed either as a case of pseudo-incorporation or as a frozen idiom.
9.6. Summary
We have seen from the previous sections that verbal classiﬁcation is one of the main parts of the Bardi complex predicate system. Under this analysis, the inﬂecting verb acts as a classiﬁer of the preverb, indicating the type of event the preverb refers to. I have not attempted to give an exhaustive account of the functions of the different verbal classiﬁers in every single classiﬁer construction; rather I have highlighted some of the more salient patterns in the data. Table 13.2 gives a summary of these ﬁndings. I believe that an account

558 Preverbs and Complex Predicates
of complex predication which attempts to capture every nuance of the event is unhelpful at this stage; it is probably based more on the English glosses than on the semantics of the Bardi complex predicates. Furthermore, the Bardi complex predicate system shows signs of being based around prototypical models and analogical extensions, rather than a rigid categorial system where each event is classiﬁed as belonging to a particular type.

Chapter 14 Adverbs and Particles
In these ﬁnal three chapters, I describe phrasal and clausal phenomena. This chapter contains adverbs, interjections, and the clitics which have not yet been discussed in other sections. However, clitics which link clauses are to be found in Chapter 16.
Adverbial meanings in Bardi are distributed between true adverbs (that is, words in the clause which are not arguments and which modify the clause or a part of it) and preverbs, for which see Chapter 13. There is some overlap in word class, since preverb is a syntactic position in Bardi as well as a type of word; that is, some true adverbs can also be used as preverbs in certain circumstances. In this chapter I discuss only ‘true’ adverbs. Somewhat confusingly, preverbs have also occasionally been called ‘adverbs’ in work on Australian languages, such as in Merlan (1994) on Wardaman.
Adverbs are fairly numerous in the dictionary, with 352 adverb headwords appearing, comprising 7.3% of the total number of headwords in the dictionary. This makes adverbs the third most numerous word class, after nouns and preverbs. Adverbs provide additional information about the location, manner, or intensity of the event in a verbal predicate. They can also provide some information about the relationship of participants to each other and that action (for example, whether the action was completed amboon ‘together’ or ngoordingan ‘separately’). They can also provide information about the stance of the speaker and their view of the event. Location, manner, and temporal adverbs together account for the majority of adverbs in the corpus.
I begin this chapter with a deﬁnition of adverbs (in §14.1); I then summarize the major classes of adverbs in the data: location and motion adverbs (§14.2), manner and intensity adverbs (§14.3), temporal, aspectual, and event adverbs (§14.4), and adverbs of ‘state’ and stance (§14.5).
1. Deﬁnition of adverbs
Adverbs in Bardi can be identiﬁed by a combination of their lack of nominal inﬂection, such as possession or case marking, and their ability to appear at more then one place in the clause (that is, in the ﬂexibility of their constituent

562 Adverbs and Particles

order). These two criteria together distinguish them from preverbs (which appear strictly before the inﬂecting verb) and nouns (which take the full range of case markers). Many ‘adjectives’ also can be used as adverbs with zero derivation. (14.1) provides an example.

(14.1) Moorrooloo inarligal, moorrooloo roowil innyan.

Moorrooloo i-na-rli-gal,

moorrooloo roowil i-n-nya-n.

little

3-TR-eat-REC.PST little

walk 3-TR-catch

‘He ate a little, walked a little.’

Adverbs tend to appear initially, pre- or post-verbally (that is, around the verb phrase including the preverb and inﬂecting verb), around another type of phrase that they modify (e.g. a noun phrase), and ﬁnally in the clause. Adverbs can host the clitic =gij ‘very’.
Adverbs can modify different types of constituents. They can modify whole clauses, such as gardilba ‘perhaps’, illustrated in (14.2). They can modify verb phrases. Functionally, they provide information about the manner of an action, aspect (whether an action is completed, for example) and other temporal information, information about the state of a participant (e.g. the state a person was in at the time of an action), and about location.

(L155.021)

While most adverbs are underived, there are some adverbial items which contain fossilized case marking. The case marking in such items is not productive and the words appear to be treated as underived items. Some adverbs may appear both with and without a case marker, and in those cases, there is no obvious meaning difference. The pair ilarrilarr and ilarrilarrgoon, for

Location, direction, and motion 563
example, both mean ‘hands behind back’. Mayalgarra and mayalgarran ‘in the afternoon’ are found in the same text in exactly the same phrases, and speakers do not identify any difference in meaning. In some Australian languages (such as GupapuyNu (Lowe 1960), a YolNu language), the case of an adverb is affected by the tense of the clause. This is not the case in Bardi. Nor is the case related to the transitivity of the verb.

2. Location, direction, and motion
Locative adverbs can modify whole clauses, predicates, or noun phrases. They also participate in the discourse-determined word order constructions which Bardi shows; that is, when they appear initially they are in focus and have the status of new information.

2.1. Static location

Location adverbs can provide information about where an event is located with respect to a place. Such items include angan ‘close’ and mara ‘far’; they also include adverbs such as aalgana ‘in the sun’. Some items appear with both static location and motion (to be discussed further below); others, such as aalgana, are static.

(14.3) Aalgana ngagalanda, inkoorrnim alig ngandan.
Aalgana nga-galand-a, inkoorr-nim alig nga-n-d-an. in.the.sun 1-sit-FUT, cold-ERG pain 1-TR-do/say-CONT

3M.FUT-have-CONT 3M.POSS-stomach-LOC inside.

‘Open that pearlshell in case it has a pearl (lit. ‘egg’) inside.’

Location adverbs of this type most often occur either ﬁnally in the clause, or immediately preverbally (both these positions are found in the examples above). If the speciﬁc location is given, the locative adverb appears adjacent to the location (though note that it may appear on either side). The placement of such items is not evenly distributed throughout the clause, however. In a count of the examples of the adverb boogoon ‘inside’ in the corpus, the adverb appears initially only seven times (out of 98 examples), while it was clauseﬁnal 43 times. The adverb was used clausally or without a speciﬁc location in 51 of the examples; it was part of a locational phrase in 42 examples, and a preverb in a complex predicate construction in 5 examples. Note that these counts include both static location and motion uses of the adverb (‘to inside’ vs. (be) inside), however the static uses comprise the vast majority of examples for this adverb.

(14.6) Marroolinyan jirrjirr injij.
Marroolinyan jirrjirr i-n-j-ij. facing.away stand 3-TR-do/say-PFV

‘He’s standing facing the opposite direction.’

Over a hundred location adverbs are recorded in the Bardi dictionary. Some of the most common adverbs which refer to static location are given in Table 14.1.
Ngoonjoon is an adverb that has both causal and locational uses. When describing a location, it is used to describe the starting place for a delimited area of reference; in (14.7), for example, ngoonjoon marks the starting point of the pain which radiates down the shoulder.

2.2. Location on body

Body parts tend to have location speciﬁed without an adverb. That is, the body part appears in the locative case. However, there are also some locative adverbs that make reference to body parts, such as ilogo ‘on one’s side’ and goondoo ‘across the shoulder’. The recorded adverbs are listed in (14.8).

(14.8)

a. ilogo ‘on one’s side’ b. goondoo ‘across the shoulder’ c. niyanan ‘across one’s back’ d. rangoon ‘upside down, on one’s stomach’ e. bodawin ‘at the throat’

566 Adverbs and Particles
Additionally, there are adverbs which refer to body position, such as moonmoorroo ‘stomach to stomach’ or midimidi ‘kneeling’. Midimidi shows another characteristic of body part adverbs; that is, there are several which are reduplications of body part terms. Midimidi itself is the reduplicated form of the root of the obligatorily possessed word ni-midi ‘knee’ (the word midi does not exist on its own). Another example is langanalangana ‘shoulder to shoulder’, which is illustrated in (12.22).

2.3. Dynamic motion

A further set of adverbs provide information about motion, that is, information about location/direction which is not either about the end point or the starting point. These can include information about the path of motion (including nirirrjarr ‘along the cliffs’, noodoorrgony ‘up the creek’, or alalankarr ‘along the sand-cliffs’). Also included here are adverbs which refer to tidal motion: joodarrarr ‘with the tide’ and arrinarr ‘against the tide’.

cross.over 3-TR-put-REM.PST with.the.tide going.out

‘He crossed over with the tide as it was going out.’

(MNJ.012)

Many of the adverbs described in §14.2.1 can be used in conjunction with the allative (§5.4.4) or ablative (§5.4.5) cases to mark the goal or source of motion respectively. In that case, they appear either in conjunction with a noun phrase marked in the appropriate case, or receive case themselves.

2.4. Cardinal directions

Table 14.2 gives Bardi cardinal directions. While there are four of them, they are not equally spaced. The terms for ‘South’, ‘East’, and ‘West’ are fairly similar to their English counterparts, but the term for ‘North’, ardi, is not true north but rather skewed a little to the East. Compass points can receive the marker -ngarr (discussed in Chapter 5). It is also possible to use the allative case on the bare stem, but they are also rarely found; ardingan ‘to the north’ was used spontaneously, however.196

Compass points are not extensively used in my corpus as ways of giving directions. Froms such as olonggo ‘from the south’ are attested, but not used with any frequency. An example of a compass point is given in (14.13). When giving directions, story-tellers use place names most commonly. That is, rather than describing a direction in terms of compass points, they will say ‘to Sunday Island’ or ‘in the direction of Oombinarr.’ This more typical use is illsutrated in (14.14).

(BSS1.003)

The next most common way to give directions is to use nyanbirronony ‘the other side’ and banbirrnony ‘this side’. Nyanbirronony more speciﬁcally refers to the Mayala islands and the mainland in Worrorran country.

2.5. Relative directions: left and right

Bardi has words for ‘left’ and ‘right’.

(14.15) a. joorroonggoo ‘right’; joorroongganyi niimarla ‘right hand’ b. ngalgarrman ‘left’, ngalgordony ‘left (hand)’

Two words for ‘left’ are recorded in the dictionary: ngalgarrman (recorded by Metcalfe and conﬁrmed by Nancy Isaac) and ngalgordony. The latter contains the lative case marker -gony(i) but it appears fossilized; in the word for ‘right (hand)’, the lative is not found in the word for ‘right’, but is found in the phrase joorroongganyi niimarla ‘right hand’. The word for ‘right (hand)’ is not the same as the word for ‘correct’ or ‘true’, but it can be used to mean ‘straight’ (as opposed to ‘crooked’).
These words can be used for direction and location (‘on the right’):

3. Manner adverbs

Bardi has a rich collection of adverbs describing the manner in which actions are performed. There are about 75 in the corpus, some of the most common and representative of which are listed in Table 14.3. Examples are given in (14.18).

(14.18)

a. Jilybang jirrjirr injij. Jilybang jirrjirr i-n-j-ij. on.tiptoe stand 3-TR-do-PFV

‘He is standing on tiptoe.’

(Dictionary)

b. Bard inamankarna laanybi, innyanajirr goorlil.

Bard i-na-mankar-na laanybi,

goorlil.

3-TR-catch-REM.PST=3A.IO turtle

‘He carried it off thievingly, he took their turtle.’ (BE: CB52.1)

Some of these adverbs double as preverbs; several combine with -nya‘catch’ (though not all items which combine with preverbs can also be adverbs), and while some have transparent meanings, in other cases the meaning is idiomatic.

(14.19) a. joornk -inya- ‘run’ b. laanybi -inya- ‘steal’

English
just, a little bit properly concealed, while keeping hidden secretly, without people knowing to the death fast quickly on tiptoe slowly unexpectedly competently with effort invisibly thievingly

Manner adverbs tend to occur immediately following or preceding the verb (as shown in (14.18) above), and some of them can also double as preverbs. McGregor (in press) describes some of these cognate items in Nyulnyul as preverbs, and therefore allows that Nyulnyul has preverbs which need not be strictly preverbal. I prefer to analyze the Bardi forms as adverbs, however, rather than potentially movable preverbs. The description of the syntax of complex predicates does not beneﬁt from treating these items as movable preverbs; it makes the otherwise quite clear distinction between preverbs and adverb less clear, and it obscures the fact that manner adverbs pattern like location and temporal adverbs in their ability to combine with complex predicates and in their placement in the clause.
A few other manner adverbs overlap with the location domain. Mardal ‘keeping one’s distance’, for example, could be categorized as either locational or manner.

4. Time reference adverbs
The ﬁnal large class of adverbs is the set of temporal adverbs. They can be split into those that mark absolute time reference, relative time reference, and

Time reference adverbs 571

aspectual adverbs (or others that refer to the temporal structure of an event). These are summarized in Table 14.4. Various other temporal markers, such as days of the week, are also discussed in this section.
Temporal adverbs are most frequently either initial or ﬁnal in the clause. While it is not certain what conditions the different placement, I assume that it is related to larger considerations of information structure and to the fact that new information always appears ﬁrst in the clause. Therefore, if the temporal information is conﬁned to clause peripheral positions and another constituent is occupying the initial focus position, the temporal adverb will appear ﬁnally. This ﬁts many examples, but in other cases, the temporal adverb appears to be extra-positive. That is, it does not receive the focal intonation associated with new information, which instead appears on the following item. This is a topic for further research.

Time reference adverbs 573
4.1. Absolute reference
A subset of temporal adverbs have absolute time reference. Included here are parts of the day and the season terms described above in §2.2.1.

4.1.1. Parts of the day

The Bardi day is divided into several parts. In addition to the words given in Table 14.4 above, there are several other words which refer to times of day, but they were either found only in old sources or appear without illustration.

(14.22)

a. Very early in the morning, before daybreak: jalbany

b. Dawn: rarrbankarrarda, rarrbarr

c. Morning: mooyoon

d. Day time: joombal

e. Midday: (phrase)

boolngoorroo morr i-n-joo-gal

aalga

middle

f. Mid afternoon: mayalgarra(n)

g. Late afternoon: injooloolin

h. Just before sunset: jimbinkiji (not known nowadays)

i. Last light: nganbi

j. Just after sunset: ooladaji

k. Night: iidanngoorroon

These times are often used as preverbs in impersonal complex predicates, rather than as adverbs. In such examples, the complex predicate is often accompanied by an ‘ethic dative’ use of the oblique pronoun (see further §10.4).

(14.23) Mooyoon rarrb injoonoojirr booroo.

574 Adverbs and Particles

These adverbs can be used to mark the extent of a temporal period. In (14.24), we see a complex temporal phrase where the source case, combined with doubling, is used to signal that the event is happening ‘month after month.’

‘They cut up that whale month after month.’

(HHW.031)

4.1.2. Days of the week

Words for days of the week were introduced in the mission period in the late nineteenth century. These days, English names are mostly used with codeswitching (that is, with unadapted phonology), but two are found fully adapted, and one (Monday) is a phrase meaning ‘washing day’.

(14.25)

a. jaandi ‘Sunday’ b. wajimarra booroo ‘washing day’: Monday c. jarridi ‘Saturday’

4.1.3. Other absolute time words
The words aalga ‘day’, goowid(i) ‘month’ and lalin ‘year’ are primarily nouns, and therefore are not listed among the temporal adverbs in Table 14.4. They are all polysemous, with aalga having the primary meaning ‘sun’, goowidi ‘moon’ and lalin is the time of the year when turtles mate (usually in late November). The word booroo ‘place’ is also used to mean ‘time’ and ‘tide’, and appears in the Laves texts several times in the meaning ‘day’. An example of the use of goowidi in the meaning ‘month’ appears in (14.24)

Time reference adverbs 575
above, and booroo is found as a time word in (14.23) and (14.25b). Words for seasons were given in §2.2.1.

4.2. Relative reference

There are several relative temporal words in Bardi. The most common include bardi ‘yesterday’ and ngoorriji ‘tomorrow’.197 Some Australian languages have a single word which refers to one day either side of the current day, but Bardi does not. There is also a word bardigij, derived from bardi ‘yesterday’, which means ‘within the last few days, within the last week.’

Further examples follow. (14.27c) shows that temporal adverbs which are ﬁrst in the clause can still be hosts for clausal clitics.

4.3. Duration adverbs
There are adverbs which give information about the duration of an event. These range from events of very short duration, marked with wiira ‘temporarily, for a little while’, to events which last forever (joodiny(ko)).198 There are also adverbs such as galgoon ‘seldom’ which provide information about the frequency of the event, rather than its duration. These adverbs are also initial, ﬁnal, and preverbal.

‘He still really wasn’t happy, he kept digging.’

(L159.003)

Several of these items have similar glosses in English (aankoo and wiira, for example) and the precise differences between them are not currently known. In other cases there may be dialectal differences. Aankoo, for example, is only attested in the Laves texts, though it was recognized and conﬁrmed in recent work.
To mark that an event happened for a certain number of days or hours, a time phrase is used. These are null-marked. (14.30) provides an example.

(14.30) Biindan gooyarra booroo ingamoolgoon.

Biindan gooyarra booroo i-nga-moolgoo-n.

scrub two

time/day 3-PST-sleep-CONT

‘He slept in the bush for two days.’

(L58b.099)

4.4. Aspectual adverbs
Finally, there are a couple of adverbs which are aspectual in nature; that is, they provide information about whether the event is completed or repeated. These are biila ‘again’, garrgooy ‘completely’, and gardaban gardabana ‘over and over again’.
There are two words, biila and biiligij (with the intensive clitic) which are both translated by speakers as ‘again’. Laves sometimes glosses biiligij as

578 Adverbs and Particles

‘even harder’; a good translation might be ‘yet more’ or ‘yet again’. Biila, the underived form, simply means ‘once more’.

(14.31) Biiligij ingalamankana gala anganagij bornko bornko injoonoongirr.

Biiligij i-nga-lamanka-na

gala angana=gij bornko

(BBN1.012)

‘He danced even harder.’

(L59.010)

Examples of garrgooy ‘completely’ are given below. In most cases, the adverb signals that the action has been done completely or thoroughly (for example, in (14.33), that the ﬁsh are fully (not partially) cooked. In other cases it serves the function of making some types of cancelable predicates non-cancelable (cf. Grice 1989:39-40). In Bardi, verbs like -gardi- ‘drown’ and -jimbi- ‘die’ have cancelable implications, unlike their English translations. That is, sentences like ‘he drowned, but they ﬁshed him out and he was all right’ are grammatical and felicitous in Bardi. However, using the adverb garrgooy marks the implication as non-cancelable.

5. Other adverbs

5.1. Modal and emotion adverbs

There are adverbs which provide information about the truth value of the event, the speaker’s suppositions about the event, and the degree of actuality of the event. They have the same distribution as other adverbs. The examples presented below are typical.

5.2. Adverbs of exchange
There are a number of adverbs that talk about the action in context. One way in which reciprocity can be marked in a clause is through the use of the adverb rooban. This is not a true reciprocal in that it does not mark actions that are symmetrical. Rather, it describes alternations in behavior—that is, an action that someone does in response to another.

6. Wackernagel (second position) clitics
Bardi has several clausal clitics which occur attached to the ﬁrst phonological word in a clause. Some of these have a straightforward adverbial meaning; others provide information about the clause in relation to other clauses. There are also clitics which attach to an individual word and give additional meaning about that word. Some of these items have been described already; others, such as the clause chaining particles, are more appropriately described in

582 Adverbs and Particles

conjunction with other processes of clause combination (for which see Chapter 16 below). Table 14.6 gives the second position clitics in the data. Here I discuss =ninga and =jangarr. Note that some information about =jangarr in its quantiﬁcational use was also provided in §10.5 above, and =gij was discussed in §6.1.4, and so is not repeated here.

(BE: CB52.2)

The sufﬁx seems to be related to the word for ‘name’, ninga, which takes inalienable possession. As (14.40) above shows, however, =ninga does not agree in person with its host.
Metcalfe (1975a) has an example where ninga is freestanding and initial in the clause:

This example cannot be an example of the noun meaning ‘name’, but it does not ﬁt the pattern of other examples with this word. All my examples have =ninga following the item in focus. Perhaps a word (such as ngayoo 1MIN) has been omitted in Metcalfe’s example.

6.2. ‘Only’: =(j)angarr
The ﬁnal clitic to consider is =(j)angarr. Metcalfe (1975b) treats a sufﬁx -jangarr or -angarr as a purely verbal sufﬁx marking ‘emphasis’. This

584 Adverbs and Particles

clitic is very frequently found on other words, however; much more so than the other clitics considered to mark quantiﬁcation. Nicolas (1998) glosses it ‘seulement’, and the equivalent English translation ‘only’ or ‘solely’ would ﬁt most contexts. In other cases, the clitic seems to give an idea of ‘whole’ (as explained by Nancy Isaac). (14.44) provides some examples of verbs, and (14.45) of words other than verbs.

The same problem regarding forms with initial consonantal and vocalic forms which were discussed for =(b)al above are also found for this clitic. Example (14.46) provides us with a rare example of a form in which the vowelinitial form of the clitic is attached to a stem which ends in a vowel on the surface; moreover, the regular lenition product of this context (outside of clitics) would be moonyooloowangarr, moonyoolooyangarr, or moonyoolangarr,

Discourse particles and exclamatives 585

depending on which rules are followed. The form in (14.46) shows none of these outcomes, instead exhibiting a form with vowels in hiatus.199 However, there are no morphological conditions which can be found to govern the presence or absence of the initial consonant. There may be dialectal variants, but there is no obvious speaker-based conditioning environment either.

In a few other cases, =jangarr has the function of an exclamative/intensiﬁer. Example (14.47) was said of the computer which was taking a long time to search all the ﬁles for a particular audio track.

7. Discourse particles and exclamatives
7.1. Stance particles
Several different types of ‘particles’ indicating the speaker’s stance towards a particular topic are found in the language. They are given in Table 14.7.
7.1.1. Garra
Garra is a narrative particle which is used to indicate that the action of a story is continuing in the same way for a while, and that we are skipping to the next installment of the story. It frequently occurs doubled (or tripled), and

(GGG.021–22)

7.1.2. Gala

The particle gala is very difﬁcult to translate. It has aspectual connotations in some cases, that the action is completed. In other cases it is used in the sense of ‘go on then,’ ‘right’, or ‘let’s do it.’

(14.50) Gala jawa aarlingan. Gala jawa aarli-ngan. right 1+2m ﬁsh-ALL

‘Right, let’s go ﬁshing.’

It can also be used in phrases such as gala gorna ‘it’s good, it’s all right’. It is a very common particle, with 800 examples in the corpus; it is well attested in all periods and by all speakers. Its cognate in Nyikina is galiya, which has a similarly wide range of uses. Further examples of gala are given below. It can occur in all positions in the clause, but tends to occur either initially, immediately postverbally, or ﬁnally.

(JMI.018)

7.1.3. Nyiindoo ‘probably’

This particle is used when the speaker is hedging, as opposed to committing to the truth of the statement. To assert the truth of the statement, gala or man is used.

‘When it gets wet again he climbs back up, probably the same crocodile, maybe a different one, because we don’t know.’ (LPB.012)

7.2. Interjections
The interjections in my data are warday, oi, ay, and arra. The interjection warday always occurs initially in the clause. It signals the speaker’s surprise (and perhaps dismay) at something. It can also occur alone. It is usually uttered with high intonation and with a ﬁnal glottal stop; the ﬁrst syllable is often also heavily rounded, so the word sounds like [wOãAj]. This word is widespread in the Kimberley.

‘He came this way, and said, “Oh look, there’s a moon-head man

(with a pith helmet) coming this way.”’

(HHW.012)

The interjection oi is used approximately the same way that <oy> is used in colloquial Australian English. It is used for getting someone’s attention. This is also true of arra. There is a negator particle arra which has the same phonological form, but a different phonetic one. The interjection arra has a shorter trill and ends in a glottal stop. There is also a single recording of the form arragi in Metcalfe (1975a), given in (14.56). It does not appear in my data.

(14.56) Arragi jiib inngooloonjowi.
Arragi jiib i-n-ngooloo-n=jowi. look-DISC there 3-TR-throw-CONT=1+2.IO

‘Oh! Maybe it’s from here that he’s throwing (the stone) at us.’ (Metcalfe 1975a:-gi)

Finally, there is ay, which is somewhat similar to Australian English eh? in that it is often used to ask for clariﬁcation or repetition. It has rising intonation. It may also be used with a long vowel (and often some creaky voice and lowered intonation) as a way of signaling disapproval.

Chapter 15 Intra-clausal Syntax
This chapter concerns the relation of words in a clause (or sentence) in the broadest sense. It includes evidence for constituency within the clause; I discuss evidence for argument structure and the syntactic relations between nominal and verbal phrases. Since Bardi morphology is so complex, we might be tempted to describe Bardi syntax purely in terms of the morphology. This may be even more the case when we consider the small role that constituent order plays in Bardi syntax, in comparison to the role it plays in discourse and information structure. There is, however, a lot more to say about clause combination than the morphology of lexical items or the order of words in the clause.
The chapter begins with an overview of constituency and the evidence for syntactic constituents in the language (§15.1 below). I then move to an examination of different clause types in the language: clauses without verbs (§15.2), other copular constructions and the possibilities for verbal and nonverbal predicate structure (e.g. with -ni- ‘sit, be, be located’). I then discuss various other topics in the syntax of clauses: negation in §15.3, questions (in §15.4), commands, and causatives.
1. Constituency and constituent order
1.1. Evidence for constituents
In §8.1 I provided evidence for the existence of noun phrases in Bardi and discussed internal constituency. There is also some evidence for larger constituents. Clauses can be deﬁned at their left edge by the placement of clausal clitics such as =min and =gid (see §16.2 and Table 16.1), which attach to the ﬁrst word of the clause. Other items, such as ginyinggon ‘and then’, always occur ﬁrst in the clause (see further §16.3).
Some other types of phrases are, however, harder to deﬁne. There is no evidence for an adjective phrase, since adjectives do not take complements. There are possessive phrases, which comprise a (possessor) noun phrase, a possessive pronominal marker, and a possessum (discussed above in §8.6)

592 Intra-clausal Syntax
but these three constituents can occur in any order.
(15.1) PossP :: NPp r PossPro NPp m
There is very little evidence for a verb phrase. There are no substitution tests which target the verb and its object alone, and other tests, such as clefting, do not work clearly, because the cleft marker occurs after the ﬁrst word of the phrase. That is, we gain information about the left edge of such phrases, but not the right edge. The only asymmetries between subjects and objects are in morphological case marking and in the agreement which appears on the verb; tests are given in §15.1.4 below.

1.2. Free constituent order

Bardi has highly free word order, free ellipsis, and pragmatically determined argument structure. The language thus satisﬁes the traditional criteria for a nonconﬁgurational language (Baker 2000, Hale 1983, Speas 1990).
Word order at the clausal level in Bardi is largely determined by discourse and principles of pragmatics, grounding, and focus. Gross word order in Bardi follows Mithun’s principle (Mithun 1992) of ‘new information ﬁrst.’ The topic position is ﬁnal when topics are contrastive, although topics are more frequently omitted entirely. As Pensalﬁni (2004:371) notes for Jingulu, purely functional and pragmatic considerations cannot be used to determine word order entirely, as pragmatic discourse categories such as topic are also morphologically marked and do not have to coincide with the regular placement of topics in the constituent order.
No purely syntactic information is encoded in the word order of clausal constituents. As seen from (15.2), all permutations are possible.

Although the examples in (15.2) were elicited, examples of free order are easy to ﬁnd. Bowern (2008a) reports on counts of major clause constituents in several texts. The following are the counts based on two typical texts from Tudor Ejai (Text 1) and David Wiggan (Text 2). The ﬁrst column gives the order in question; the second is the number of occurrences of this order in the texts. The third column is this ﬁgure expressed as a percentage of total clauses. In the ﬁnal two columns, the two texts are compared; percentages are given as a fraction of the total number of that type of word order. Text 1 was recorded by C.D. Metcalfe in 1970 and is about a drunken man who talks to his dog and dances with it; Text 2 was recorded in 1990 by Gedda Aklif and is a traditional story about a woman and her two daughters traveling to ﬁnd a husband.
From these statistics we might conclude that the basic word order of Bardi is V! Of 171 clauses, almost half contained no overt nominal or pronominal core arguments at all. Of the other orders, VS and VO have approximately the same frequency (between 13% and 15%). Less common again (5%-7%) are the SV and OV orders. Most of the VS and VO orders appear in the ﬁrst text, while most attestations of SV occur in the second. While ﬁgures reported here are small, they are broadly consistent with the larger corpus.200

1.3. Other ordering preferences
This lack of overt material and preponderance of verb-initial (or verb-only) orders is explicable when considering the information structure of narratives and the targets of ellipsis. Kuno’s (1982) observation that ellipsis targets recoverable information seems to hold true generally for Bardi (see also Croft 2007, Givo´n 1990). Omitted arguments are old information and form part of the ‘common ground’ in the discourse. Thus nominal arguments that appear are already marked just by their presence. On this point see also Mushin (2005) and Swartz (1991), who make similar observations for the Australian languages Garrwa and Warlpiri respectively.

1.3.1. Initial position
There are two positions where privileged information is introduced: clause initially, and clause ﬁnally. Novel information (whether verbal, nominal, or

Constituency and constituent order 595

adverbial) occurs ﬁrst in the clause. New characters in a story, for example, always appear initially in the clause at their ﬁrst mention. Answers to questions are initial, as shown in (15.3).

(15.3)

a. Anggaba miyarginjin(a)? Anggaba mi-yargi-n=jin(a)? who 2-be.afraid.of-CONT=3M.IO
‘Who are you frightened of?’ b. Aamba ngayarrginjin.
Aamba nga-yargi-n=jin. man 1-be.afraid.of-CONT=3M.IO
‘I’m scared of [a] man.’

(L56.056–57)

In clauses where the same character performs a string of actions, the verbs of those clauses are initial; the action (or change of action) is new information. This position thus has the core characteristics of a position for syntactic focus (see, e.g. Dalrymple 2001:182-185), and speciﬁcally identiﬁcational focus (Kiss 1998). Other word classes (including adverbs and pronouns) can also receive focus if they are ‘newsworthy’ (see Mithun 1998 for the term). Either a single word or an entire phrase can be the initial focal element of the clause. Second position clitics, however, are not sensitive to this position; they appear enclitic on the initial phonological word of the clause whether or not that word constitutes the entire focused element.
In addition to being initial in the clause, items in focus receive a pitch peak on their stressed syllable. Examples of different types of constituents in initial position are given in (15.4), and a pitch track showing the typical intonation contour of a new information/focused element can be found in Figure 15.1.

There is a further class of information which is not ‘new’ to the listener but nonetheless occurs in initial position in the clause. In all cases of this position that I have examined, non-novel new information could be analyzed as bearing contrastive focus (Kiss 1998). That is, it occurs particularly when two participants are contrasted with one another along some dimension.

Therefore I will be referring to initial position as the ‘focus’ position, and this term should be taken to cover not only identiﬁcational focus but also novel information and contrastive focus.
Within initial position, there is some evidence that either a single element can be focused, or a whole phrase, but not several parts of phrases. Consider (15.8).

(15.8)

kangaroo horse-SIM

In this example, the (b) sentence is ungrammatical. Note that this is not a general prohibition on clause interleaving, since there are numerous other examples of clauses where elements of a subsidiary clauses have a linear order

598 Intra-clausal Syntax
where the main clause intervenes. The problem in this particular example appears to be that the item under focus is not a single constituent, since there is no evidence that the verb and its subject NP form a constituent, and aamba cannot be the subject of the other verb in the clause (inangajimij), because it is not marked for ergative case.

1.3.2. Final position

Final position in the clause is the most usual position for reintroduced old information. There is a strong correlation between the use of the third person minimal participant tracker pronoun ginyingg(i) and ﬁnal position in the clause.

I follow Mithun (1992) in noting that although there is a strong correlation between constituent order and pragmatics, I do not deny that there are exceptions. Some of these exceptions could be due to the misidentiﬁcation of the speaker’s pragmatic intent. In a clause with only two elements, it may be hard to tell whether the second item is marked as ‘old information’ or the ﬁrst is in

Constituency and constituent order 599
focus. Furthermore, the expression of new information focus and participant tracking is not wholly dependent on constituent order; verb morphology and determiners also play a role. The jarr- direct and oblique object markers discussed in §10.3.2.1 above, for example, also signal participant reference and pragmatic tracking.

1.4. Evidence for a verb phrase

There are several types of evidence used to show whether a language has a phrasal constituent which includes the verb and its object. Some involve movement and substitution. The English phrase ‘do so’, for example, targets the VP, in that it replaces the verb and its object, not a verb alone, as illustrated in (15.11):

(15.11)

a. At the pet shop yesterday, Penny bought a goldﬁsh, and Rob did too.
b. *Penny bought a goldﬁsh, and Rob did too a rabbit.

English verb phrases can also be moved as a single constituent, as in ‘clean the parrots’ cage she did, much to my surprise.’
Bardi has no equivalent of English ‘do so,’ and as noted above, movement tests are not revealing because of the freedom of discourse-based word order. There are, however, other tests involving semantics, co-reference, and asymmetries between subjects and objects which can be used to probe for the presence of a VP. These include binding and weak crossover effects.201 ‘Binding’ refers to the way in which nouns and pronouns (that is, ‘referring expressions’ or R-expressions) receive interpretation and whether they receive their interpretation from the real world, or by optional or obligatory coreference with another item in the clause. Reﬂexive pronouns, for example, are obligatorily coreferential with another item in the clause. Moreover, in many languages there are structural restrictions on the relations which can hold between items in a clause, such as which structural positions can provide an antecedent for (that is, bind) a reﬂexive pronoun. In English, for example, subjects can bind reﬂexives, but possessors within a subject cannot:

(15.12) a. Heidii bopped herselfi on the head with a zucchini.

b. * [Heidii’s mother] j bopped herselfi on the head with a

zucchini.

(Carnie 2002:92)

600 Intra-clausal Syntax

Binding principles thus give us information about the structural positions in which arguments are located. Many languages have ﬁrm constraints on how coreference and antecedence works. Differences in binding facts are, however, a point of cross-linguistic variation. Binding tests are also good tests for the presence of a VP node, as subjects bind objects within a VP. A subset of binding effects are known as crossover effects, because they involve the interaction of binding and word order effects. For example, the sentence *Whoi does shei see i? is ungrammatical if the interrogative pronoun who is coreferential with the subject pronoun.
Bardi show no effects of binding, crossover, or VP ellipsis. In (15.13a), for example, we see that the R-expression appears to be bound. (15.13b) was the translation given for the English prompt sentence; (15.13c) has the same meaning and uses an overt pronoun for the possessor. All of these sentences are grammatical in the meanings given (though note that the English equivalents are not).

(15.13)

a. Marynim jina birrii injalagal. Maryi-nim jinai birrii i-n-jala-gal. M.-ERG 3M.POSS mother 3-TR-see-REC.PST=3MDOi.

‘Mary’s mother sees her.’ / ‘Mary sees her mother.’

b. Birriinimin injalagaljin Mary.

Birrii j-nim=ini

i-n-jala-gal=jini

Maryi.

mother-ERG=3M.POSSi 3-TR-see-REC.PST=3MIN.IOi Mary.

‘Heri mother sees Maryi.’

c. Ginyingginimjin birrii injalagal Mary.

Ginyinggi-nim=jini birrii i-n-jala-gal

Maryi.

3MIN-ERG=3M.POSS mother 3-TR-see-REC.PST M.

‘Heri mother sees Maryi.’

(NI: BOW-FN.12/21)

In both (15.13b) and (15.13c), we see a binding violation, where the pronoun in subject position (marked with the ergative case) is apparently binding (that is, is coreferential with) the object. If the object is hierarchically lower in the clause tree than the subject, this should not be grammatical. This is thus evidence against a VP node in the clause.
We also see apparent violations of weak crossover; that is, in sentences such as (15.14), the ergative marked interrogative pronoun anggaba-nim ‘who’ is coreferential with the possessive clitic jin ‘her (3MIN.POSS)’. The Bardi sentence is grammatical, though its English translation is not.

Non-verbal predicates (copular constructions) 601

(15.14) Anggabanim injalanajin birrii?

Anggaba-nimi i-n-jala-na=jini

birrii?

who-ERG 3-TR-see-REC.PST=3MIN.IO mother

‘Whoi saw heri mother?’

(NI: BOW-FN.12/22)

Thus there is no evidence that the verb and an object noun phrase form a constituent in Bardi.

1.5. Summary
In summary, while there is good evidence for clause-level phrases, noun phrases, and possessive phrases, there is no evidence for a verb phrase. Bardi shows other behavior which is diagnostic of nonconﬁgurationality at the phrasal level. Three related phenomena have been discussed in relation to lack of a VP; nonconﬁgurational argument structure, pronominal argument marking, and polysynthesis. In some languages, all three traits are shown, but although polysynthesis often implies non-conﬁgurationality, the reverse does not hold. Further discussion of these topics in relation to Bardi can be found in Bowern (2006b).

2. Non-verbal predicates (copular constructions)

2.1. Null copula

Bardi has nominal and adjectival (modiﬁer) predicates in addition to verbal predicates. The copula in Bardi is normally null; however, the verb -ni- ‘sit’ is also used in certain equational sentences, and frequently with predicative adjectives (though not exclusively so); more discussion follows.
Nominal predicates appear without any overt copula, as in (15.15).

(15.15) Ginyinggi aamba galgarr.

this

man widower

‘This man is a widower.’

(Aklif 1993b:2)

When the topic of the sentence is a non-third person, the nominal predicate may take the relevant form of the predicative ‘object’ marking (discussed

602 Intra-clausal Syntax

with respect to verbs in §10.3); (15.16) is an example. For the form of the clitics, and the distribution of =ngay and =jarrngay in (15.17), see further §10.3.2.

(15.16) Boojooliidarri.
Boojool-iid-a=rri. stare-AGENT-PRED=2M.DO

‘You are staring too much.’

(15.17)

a. Ngay moorrooloomarngay. Ngay moorrooloo-marr=ngay. 1MIN little-SEMB=1MIN.PRED

‘It happened when I was little.’

(NGJ/1)

b. Ngay majoonggooloojarrngay. Ngay majoonggooloo=jarrngay. 1MIN young.girl=1MIN.PRED

‘It’s me that’s the young (=unmarried) girl.’ (NI: BOW-FN.12/17)

2.1.1. Tense and null copula constructions

The tense of the clause has no effect on whether a copula is present. (15.18) provides examples where the last sentence clearly refers to past time, and there is still no copula present. (15.19) is an example where the sentence refers to future time.

(15.18)

Balab jina ngoorrij. this.way 3M.OBL tomorrow.

‘He’ll be here tomorrow.’

(Aklif 1999:balab)

2.1.2. Order of subject and predicate

There are many examples of null copula constructions in texts and conversation. The relative order of subject and predicate is ﬂexible and is governed by the focus principles described in §15.1.3.1 above. (15.20) provides two examples of identiﬁcational copula constructions, with the predicate second in the (a) example, and ﬁrst in the (b) example.

(15.20)

a. Jarri aamba garnibina. this man murderer ‘This man’s a murderer.’
b. Jalnggoogoorr jana nyami. doctor.man 1M.POSS mother’s.father ‘My grandfather was a doctorman.’

(BOW-FN12)

There is a small amount of evidence that portions of the predicate in copular constructions can be fronted, just as parts of predicates in verbal clauses can. In (15.21), for example, the demonstrative jiiba ‘this’ occurs ﬁrst in the clause, but is interpreted with may ‘food’. An alternative interpretation may be, however, that jiiba is being used adverbially.

604 Intra-clausal Syntax

(15.21) Jiiba gorna niyarra may.
Jiiba gorna ni-yarra may. this good 3-taste food.

‘This food tastes good.’

There is a preference for predicates to be possessed when describing qualities:

(15.22) a. Aman jina laya. little 3M.POSS fat

‘It’s got a little bit of fat.’

(JS)

b. Niimana jina lagoorr many 3M.POSS egg

‘It’s got a lot of eggs.’

There is a general dispreference for clauses of the form aman laya (intended to mean ‘there’s a lot of fat’), although there are a few examples in narratives with adjectival predicates (cf. boordiji ilma ‘the ilma ceremony was important/big’ in (15.18) above). I assume that this is because the default interpretation of sentences like aman laya would be ‘fat is little’, that is, that they would be interpreted as a statement about the general properties of the noun, rather than about the properties of the object under discussion.

2.1.3. Direction giving

Predicates with null copulas can be nouns, adjectives, possessive phrases, or oblique pronouns. These types of predicates have already been discussed in other chapters (see §8.4 above), with the exception of the oblique pronouns. This construction occurs with a directional word, a locational case-marked noun, or a spatial demonstrative in the subject, and the oblique pronoun in the predicate. This construction is used as an imperative or hortative; it can also be used as a general statement, as in (15.19) above.

(15.23)

a. Baarnkangan joogarra. Baarnka-ngan joogarra. outside-ALL 2AUG.IO
‘You all go outside!’

(NI, conv)

Non-verbal predicates (copular constructions) 605

b. Balab jiya! Balab jiya! this.way 2M.IO
‘Come here!’

Most of these examples are two word phrases. In none of my examples is the order anything other than noun or adverb followed by an oblique pronoun. The oblique pronoun can be cliticized to the ﬁrst word. An example from the Laves texts shows that the pronoun here is likely to be in second position, rather than predicative.

(15.24) Biila jan biindan aarlingan. Biila jan biindan aarli-ngan. again 1MIN.IO bush meat-ALL

‘I’m going to the bush for more game.’

(L10/3056)

This is the only example of a more elaborate construction; all the examples in my ﬁeld notes involve short commands.
A very similar construction comprises an adverb and case-marked nominal. These are commonly used instead of a verb of motion.

(15.25) Aranga barda nganyjinngan. Aranga barda nganyjin-ngan. others off tree-cofﬁn-ALL

‘The others went to the tree cofﬁn.’

(JMI.043)

2.2. Clauses with -ni- ‘sit’

The verb -ni- ‘sit’ also functions as a copula, in that it can translate clauses where English uses ‘is.’ An example is given in (15.26).

(15.26)

Arinyjangarr aamba inganin nyoonoo booronjin.
Arinyj=angarr aamba i-nga-ni-n nyoonoo one-ONLY man 3-PST-sit-CONT there boor-on=jin. country-LOC=3M.POSS

‘Just one person was still at home.’

(AKL:E1/19a)

606 Intra-clausal Syntax
There are four situations where a non-null copula is used. The ﬁrst is where the predicate contributes spatial information. This is the most common use of -ni- in the corpus (besides its light verb use). The second is existential; that is, rather than asserting equivalence between the subject and the predicate, the speaker is asserting the presence or existence (rather than absence) of the subject. The third case is deictic; it could be said to be both locational and existential. The last use is where -ni- functions as a light verb with an adjective. In that case, the light verb is providing aspectual information about the situation. Information on the light verb use of -ni- can be found in §13.9.2.1.
For some speakers, locational copula clauses with -ni- ‘sit’ are an alternative to those with null copulas. Others prefer the construction with the verb.

2.2.1. Location

As far as can be determined, there is no restriction on the type of subjects or predicates that can combine with -ni- ‘sit, be’. That is, it is not the case that some objects ‘sit’, others ‘stand’, and yet others ‘lie’ in a particular location (see Newman 2002 for cross-linguistic discussion). Arguments can be animate or inanimate, and of many different shapes.
Examples of location are given below. These are examples where the verb is unambiguously a full verb, and not a light verb combining with a preverb. There are many more examples of the type illustrated in (15.28), which are ambiguous between a complex predicate (angan -ni- ‘be close’) and a compositional reading.202

2.2.2. Assertion of existence

Other examples of an overt verbal predicate highlight the assertion of existence. That is, they highlight the existential status of the item, rather than its relationship to the predicate.

(15.29)

‘Don’t you go to this place because there’s a hole there.’ (GAL1.021)

608 Intra-clausal Syntax
2.2.3. Pointing out
Some examples of -ni- are both locational and existential. That is, they occur with a deictic marker such as jiiba ‘this’ and draw the listener’s attention to the place where something is. (15.32) Jiiba inin niinbil. Ngoorra daab innyi!
Jiiba i-ni-n niinbil. Ngo˙orra daab i-n-nyi! this 3-sit-CONT looks.like last.night climb.up 3-TR-catch ‘This looks like it. He climbed up (here) last night!’

2.2.4. Aspectual modiﬁcation of adjectives

The previous types of copula do not require any restriction by part of speech on the predicate. The last use of the light verb -ni- combines a preverbal adjective with -ni- in a complex predicate. A single example is given here; see §13.9.2.1 for further information.

(15.33) Garnka inin jorndi, arra ngalamarrana. Garnka i-ni-n jorndi, arra nga-la-marra-na. raw 3-sit-CONT still, NEG 1-IRR-cook-REM.PST

‘It’s still raw, I didn’t cook it.’

This aspectual marking leads to syntactic minimal pairs between sentences with a complex predicate and those with a null copula, as in (15.34) below. In (15.34a), the predicate refers to a permanent state (the length of one’s ﬁngers), while in (15.34b), that reading is not available, and the adjective is interpreted as a transient state (‘stretched out’):

(15.34)

a. Niiwandi ngamarlangay. Niiwandi nga-marla=ngay. long 1-hand/ﬁnger=1MIN
‘My ﬁngers are long.’ b. Niiwandi inin ngamarla.
Niiwandi i-ni-n nga-marla. long 3-sit-CONT 1-hand/ﬁnger
‘My ﬁngers are stretched out.’

(BOW-FN.12/2)

Negation 609

2.3. Elided verbs

A ﬁnal type of verbless clause involves cases where verbs have clearly been elided. Such examples are very rare, except in answers to questions which may have a single noun phrase standing alone as the answer. The only wellattested example is given in (15.35), where a verb of doing is implied.

(15.35) Angginim goorr? Anggi-nim goorr? what-ERG 2AUG
‘What’s wrong with you? What happened to you?’

Other examples come from conversation:

(15.36)

[BE:] “Balab jiya Canberrangan,” injijjin.

“Balab jiya Canberra-ngan,” i-n-j-ij=jin.

this.way 2MIN.IO C.-ALL

3-TR-do/say-PFV=3M.IO

‘“Come to Canberra,” she said.’

[JS:] Warday, inkoorrnim. Warday, inkoorr-nim. gosh cold-ERG

‘Gosh, that’ll be cold.’

3. Negation
There is a negation marker arra, which has several derivatives: arragij, arranga, arrajina, and arra=IO (that is, the cliticization of an oblique personal pronoun to the negator). It is used for both constituent and clausal negation.
3.1. Clausal negation
Clauses are negated in Bardi by the particle arra, which appears before the verb complex (that is, the simple verb, or the preverb in a complex predicate). Arra is also used for constituent negation, although this is rather rare when

610 Intra-clausal Syntax

there is also a verb in the clause; that is, there is a preference for verbal negation.
In Bardi, as well as in all Nyulnyulan languages but Yawuru, negated verbs are obligatorily marked for irrealis. This is an areal feature—negative verbs in Walmajarri also have this feature (Hudson 1978), for example. (15.37a)– (15.37d) provide examples of negative clauses. In (15.37a) there is an example of a negated verb. (15.37b) shows an adverb. (15.37c) provides an example of a negated possessive phrase, while (15.37d) is a negative existential.

d. Arra iindoo ginyinggi. Arra iindoo ginyinggi. NEG curlew 3min

‘It [was]n’t a curlew.’

(BBN1.010)

3.2. Double-marked negatives and constituent negation

Negatives are occasionally double-marked. In (15.38), for example, arra appears twice. The ﬁrst is an instance of constituent negation, modifying ngay ‘I’. The second is the clausal negator.

(15.38) Arra ngay arra ngalarla! Arra ngay arra nga-l-arl-a! NEG 1min NEG 1-IRR-eat-FUT

‘It wasn’t me eating it!’

(LIZ1.006)

Negation 611

Negative concord is judged to be obligatory in elicitation. A few examples of constituent negation without a main verb negator are found in the Laves corpus and elsewhere, but in elicitation such sentences were always judged to be ungrammatical. (15.39) shows an elicited sentence with judgments, and (15.40) is an example from the Laves corpus, where arragij is modifying aarli ‘ﬁsh’ and the verb is irrealis, but there is no doubled negation marking. It is unknown whether (15.40) is a transcription error or a genuine difference in the language between the older and modern sources.

(15.39) *arrajina ngaanka *(arra) oo-loo-moogar-na.

NEG

plan NEG 3-IRR-make-REM.PST

‘He didn’t make a plan.’

(CB08/BE/59.2)

(15.40) Arragiji aarli oo-lo-rr-o-na.

Arra=giji aarli oo-l-orr-o-na. NEG=EMPH ﬁsh 3-IRR-AUG-poke-REM.PST

‘They didn’t spear any ﬁsh (at all).’

(L103.017)

Nyulnyul differs from Bardi in this regard; Nyulnyul constituent negation appears with the negated constituent ﬁrst in the clause (also found in Bardi) preceded by arri (the Nyulnyul cognate of Bardi arra), but no doubled negator on the verb itself. The verb is still irrealis in both languages. The Laves construction illustrated in (15.40) is the parallel of the Nyulnyul one.
Bardi may be the innovator here, and there is evidence that obligatory doubled negation may be quite a recent phenomenon. There are a few examples in the Laves texts with constituent negation but no doubled verb negation, as mentioned above. There is one example in the Bardi dictionary (from Gedda Aklif’s notes), and one in a text recorded by Aklif from Nancy Isaac. Note that the verb in (15.41) is realis, not irrealis, however, in both cases.

(15.41)

a. Arramin, angan mingganyigal. Arra=min, angan mi-ng-ganyi-gal. NEG=THEN close 2-PST-climb-REC.PST

‘No one dusted him off, and the ash still made him look white.’ (BMF.013)

Speakers I have worked with report that sentences like this sound rather ‘oldfashioned,’ and they tend not to accept them as grammatical. I also have an example where Aklif recorded a narrative from David Wiggan in 1990, where the sentence in (15.42a) was used. However, the equivalent sentence in the transcript shows double negation (as in (15.42b)).204

It is noticeable that the examples where negative concord do not apply all have the negated constituent in postverbal position. This principle appears to apply throughout the examples in this section, not only with regular constituent negation, but also with phrases marked by the word arranga ‘without’, discussed below. Example (15.43) gives a sentence from Aklif (1999)

where arranga appears before the verb and negative concord appears; other examples in §15.3.4 show the opposite order, with realis verbs.

3.3. Arragija ‘not at all’

An alternative to arra is arragija, which means ‘not at all’. In Laves the form is sometimes arragiji. Here the negator is afﬁxed with the intensiﬁer clitic =gij(a) ‘very’. It participates in both clausal and constituent negation and is more emphatic than the plain negator arra.

Example (15.46) shows that arragij can also mean ‘nothing at all’.

3.4. Arrang(a) ‘without’

Another frequent form of negation is arranga ‘without’, which is the preferred way of negating individual nouns in the clause. Historically it is the negative marker arra ‘not, nothing’ in the instrumental case. Now the word behaves like an adverb or preposition meaning ‘without’. The ﬁnal vowel of the word is optional.

The position of arranga is ﬁxed before the noun, unlike most other words that one could call adpositions in Bardi, which have variable ordering preceding or following the noun. Compare bangalon boogoon ∼ boogoon bangalon ‘inside reef crevices’ (boogoon means ‘inside’, which acts as an adverb or adposition, and bangalon is a locative-marked noun ‘in reef crevices’), and see further §8.5.1.7 for discussion of such items.

3.4.1. Arrajina/ arrijina ‘nothing’

Arrajina is historically the negator arra ‘not’ and the possessive third person
minimal pronoun jina ‘his/her/its’. It is used primarily for negating possession, though it can also be used to negate existential constructions.205

(15.50)

this

‘He picked up my cup and spoon; they aren’t his.’ (BE: CB52.1)

The sentences in (15.50) show an interesting property of Bardi possessive negatives; that arrajina can appear as a single unit, or that the negator can appear with a possessive (or oblique) pronoun which agrees for person and number with another participant in the clause. (15.50b) above and (15.53) are examples.

(15.53) Arrajirri aarlimayi.
Arra=jirri aarlimayi. NEG=3A.POSS food

‘They didn’t have any food.’

(L103.023)

This construction can be used for both existential and possessive negation. However, while possessive negation can use either the agreeing or nonagreeing (arrajin) forms of the negator, there is a strong tendency for existential negation to use arrajin, even when there is a participant which could trigger agreement, as in (15.54).

4. Questions
There are several different ways of asking questions in the language. Polar interrogatives use either a free question word nganyji or a clitic. They may also be marked with intonation alone. There are several interrogative pronouns; they were discussed in §7.6 but a summary is repeated here for convenience. Polar questions and content questions are the only type of direct question formation processes in the language. Bardi does not have tag questions.
A fairly frequent way of questioning information is to make a statement that the listener will conﬁrm or contradict as needed. I assume that this is part of a cultural constraint often talked about in Aboriginal communities, that direct questions are considered confrontational, and are dispreferred in many social settings. While Bardi questions certainly occur in my data, I also have substantial experience of the questioning-through-statement strategy.

4.1. Polar interrogatives

There are three ways to form polar questions using morphological material. The ﬁrst is by using the interrogative particle nganyji. The particle usually appears ﬁrst in the clause, although see example (16.63) on page 663 above for an example in second position. This particle questions the proposition in the clause as a whole. Some examples are given below.

(15.56) Nganyji minjalagal jiyirr ooldoobal?

Nganyji ngay nga-n-k-iid-a Broome-ngan? NGANYJI 1MIN 1-TR-FUT-go-FUT Broome-ALL

‘Will I go to Broome?’

(JS:CB74.1)

This is the most frequent way to form polar interrogatives in my data. There are some derivatives of nganyji, such as nganyjal and nganyjirrgoordoo ‘how many’ (and in the old texts, nganyjarda). Nganyjal is marked with the indeﬁnite marker -al (see §5.1.2), which means ‘hopefully’. The phrase nganyjal irrgoordoo ‘however many’ is used in contexts of denial of knowledge, as in (15.60).

(15.59) Nganyjal darr oonkara ngoorrij.

Nganyjal darr oo-n-k-ar-a

‘We don’t know how long they lived without ﬁre.’ (GGG.008)

The second way to form a polar question is to use the clitic =(g)arda. This clitic interacts with focus and is used to question particular constituents. The clitic attaches to the item under interrogation. (It seems to have single word scope, e.g. aarlarda in the following would be ‘two FISH, or something else, like octopus?’)

Questions 619

(15.61) Gooyarrarda aarli minnyagal?

Gooyarr=arda aarli mi-n-nya-gal?

1MIN=INT go

Broome-ALL “or” 2MIN=INT

‘Will I go to Broome today or will it be you?’

The clitic =(g)arda has a clear deontic meaning. It is probably related to the adverb garda, which means ‘still’ in the sense of ‘X still did something (even though I told him not to)’; in sentences like (15.62), the sense is ‘Will I need to go to Broome?’ or ‘Will it be me that has to go?’ In contrast, nganyji does not carry the same implication.
The deontic meaning makes this clitic incompatible with some questions. For example, (15.63) is very odd, because it implies that the ball has control over its own position, and an obligation to be in a particular place.

(15.63)

Ginyinggi ball garndi i-ni-n bardag-on=kard? 3MIN ball on.top 3-sit-CONT tree-LOC=INTERROG

‘Is the ball at the top of the tree?’

(BOW-FN08)

In Nekes and Worms (1953), the authors give a word Nadje-gad (presumably nganyji-gard) and gloss it as ‘perhaps’. An example is given in (15.64). This was not accepted by my Bardi consultants, who treat nganyji purely as a question particle and do not combine it with =gard. The sentence given below is Nyulnyul, not Bardi, although Nekes and Worms 1953 list this as a Bardi phrase.

(15.64)

Nadje-gard dar il-ar

ibal banaNgar.

Nganyji-gard darr i-l-ar

i(:)bal barnanggarr.

INTERROG come 3-IRR-pierce father today.

‘Father might come today.’

620 Intra-clausal Syntax

Almost all examples of =garda apart from (15.64) come from my ﬁeld notes; it is very rare in the earlier materials. I assume this is because the deontic contexts arise most naturally in conversational data, whereas the early sources are predominantly narratives.
The third type of polar question is formed with =bard(a), which is also a clitic with identical distribution to =gard. It appears to have an epistemic function in interrogatives; that is, it questions an individual constituent and asks the question ‘was it this or something else?’

(15.65) Ginyinggi ball garndi inin bardagonbard?
Ginyinggi ball garndi i-ni-n bardagon=bard? 3MIN ball on.top 3-sit-CONT tree-LOC=INTERROG

‘Is the ball at the top of the TREE?’

(BOW-FN08)

Both =bard(a) and =gard(a) lenite when attached to a stem with a ﬁnal vowel; in both cases the form of the clitic becomes =arda and the vowel of the clitic replaces the ﬁnal vowel of the stem. This makes the two clitics identical in most cases.
The host for these clitics can be a bare or case-inﬂected noun, an adverb such as barnanggarr ‘today’, or a simple or complex predicate. Possessive pronouns cannot be hosts for such clitics; instead, a free pronoun needs to be the host, as in (15.66). The same is true in indirect questions (see (15.67)).

(BA-CB74.1)

As in many Australian languages, direct questions are dispreferred in discourse, and instead statements are made which can be conﬁrmed or denied (see, for example, Eades 1982). The speaker makes a statement of what they think is right (e.g. ‘Dad came back from Broome last night’) and the hearer conﬁrms or denies it. This is probably the closest way of forming leading questions. The interrogative marker nganyji, however, is not neutral either.206 It is used in contexts where the speaker has the expectation of a positive answer to the question. In (15.68), for example, the speaker is expecting the answer to the question to be ‘yes’.

(15.68) Nganyji lol inyjiidigal jan mayar?

Nganyji lol i-ny-jiidi-gal

jan

mayar?

INTERROG burn 3-PST-go-REC.PST 1MIN.POSS house

‘Did my house burn?’

(LK ﬁeldnotes, ex. 10.78)

This expectation of a positive answer leads to some distributional restrictions on questions with nganyji. For example, nganyji-marked questions with negative verbs are strongly dispreferred, except in contexts where the answer ‘no’ is expected. One example of this is (15.69), which involves asking a woman about whether she is allowed to listen to a song which is part of a men-only initiation ceremony:

(15.69) Nganyji arra milalamanka ginyinggi ilma? Nganyji arra mi-la-lamank-a ginyinggi ilma? INTERROG NEG 2-IRR-hear-FUT 3MIN song

‘You aren’t allowed to hear this ilma song, are you?’(CB FN, 2011)

For further information about differences between nganyji and the other question markers, and their distribution across the Bardi corpus, see Kling (2012).
The clitics can be used in forming alternative interrogatives; that is, where a speaker is given a choice of A or B. The clitic appears on each of the alternatives. This constituent order is typical for such questions, with the ﬁrst alternative initial, and the second option as a separate phrase

Polar questions can be answered by mm (sound of agreement), iyi ‘yes’ or arra ‘no’. Speakers can also use ay with intonation of disapproval to mark negation. Questions are not answered with an ‘echo’ of the question in a declarative statement (as is found in some languages of the region, particularly in New Guinea and South East Asia).

4.2. Content questions
Content questions are asked with one of a number of interrogative pronouns, which were given in Table 7.5 on page 306 above. The forms are repeated here for convenience. There was some discussion of the forms in Table 15.2 in §7.6 above. Discussion here is therefore conﬁned to the syntax of content questions, and to discussion of forms such as angan ‘why’, which are adverbial rather than pronominal and so were not treated in any depth in Chapter 7.

4.2.1. Interrogative placement and intonation

In Bardi the interrogative pronoun is usually ﬁrst in the clause, as in (15.71). The pronoun receives intonational focus, with a H* tone, as the pitch track in Figure 15.2 illustrates. Interrogative clauses also have a sharp rise at the end of the clause, which may occur over a single syllable (as in the example here) or may be longer.
Although the pronoun is usually ﬁrst in the clause, it need not be, and examples of both nganyji and anggi are found which are non-initial, and which still have an interrogative reading.

Subject, object, and oblique interrogatives are identical as far as I can tell. That is, there is no difference in the morphology or syntax of interrogatives depending on the grammatical role of the questioned argument (or adjunct). It does appear that there is an argument/adjunct distinction when there are multiple interrogatives, for which see below.

4.2.2. ‘Why’ questions: goonban(kij) and angan

There are several different ways of asking about the reason for or purpose of an event. Angan ‘why’ asks about the reason for an action or event. In contrast, anggi ‘what’ is used to ask about the purpose of an action. (15.73) gives a question (and its answer) with angan, and (15.74) shows anggi in an indirect question. It is also used in direct questions, however.

Both of these question markers are stance-neutral; goonban, on the other had, signals the speaker’s disapproval of an action and is usually translated as ‘why on earth’.207 This interrogative adverb may be qualiﬁed with =gija ‘very’.

More than one interrogative pronoun can appear in a clause. Multiple interrogatives are allowed, and there are few restrictions on the order, at least of argument interrogatives, as the grammaticality of all the sentences in (15.76) shows. The difference in meaning appears to depend on which interrogative has greater focus.208

When an interrogative is ﬁnal, the default (and preferable) reading is for it to be an indeﬁnite rather than an interrogative. Remember that Bardi interrogatives are ignoratives, and they have a wider range of use than interrogative pronouns. Thus (15.76c) has the preferred meaning ‘What did someone see?’ though it is also grammatical in the literal translation of ‘what did who see?’. All other sentences have the interpretation of English ‘who ate what?’.
Verb-ﬁrst order in the multiple interrogatives (that is, where the verb is in focus) is possible, but is dispreferred; it is grammatical, however, with the

Questions 627

right intonation, implying the speaker’s general confusion (‘they SAW something? who? what?’) Note that the English translation of the Bardi sentence is also rather odd pragmatically, if grammatically correct.

(15.77) ?? I-n-jala-gal

3-TR-see-REC.PST who-ERG what

‘Who SAW what?’

When it comes to multiple interrogatives with both arguments and adjuncts, however, the judgments are different. This is one of the few places in the grammar where there are differences between free adjunct and argument phrases. In (15.78), for example, multiple interrogatives involving janaboor ‘where’ are ﬁne when the adjunct is fronted before anggaba ‘who’, but only if the verb is ﬁnal.

Data also indicate that while multiple interrogatives of arguments are allowed if the whole argument is questioned, multiple interrogatives involving ‘how many’ are highly restricted. The example in (15.80b) was accepted, but including an instrumental interrogative (as in 15.80a) was ungrammatical. When the argument ignorative pronoun is ﬁnal in the clause, the strongly preferred reading is indeﬁnite rather than interrogative reading. This seems not

628 Intra-clausal Syntax

to be the case for the temporal interrogative and other adjunct interrogatives, at least in the sentences which were elicited here.

5. Commands and prohibitions
Bardi does not have a morphologically distinct imperative form of the verb. The future is used for second person positive commands, and the negative form of the verb in the irrealis is used for prohibitions. In complex predicates, the light verb cannot be omitted in imperatives; the light verb always receives imperative inﬂection.
5.1. Commands
Morphologically, both second person commands and hortatives which include the speaker have future marking. This is described in §11.1.3 above. Both the future preﬁx and sufﬁx appears. The second person forms are distinct in the transitive and intransitive, and they do not show the same future preﬁx ngg- ∼ nk- that the rest of the future paradigm does. This may imply that the forms were formerly not part of this paradigm but have been co-opted into it (perhaps they were originally solely imperatives). Some examples follow. (15.81) has imperatives, while (15.82) has a hortative construction.

‘“Let’s cast a spell on Bambi,” they said. “His hand will get sick.”’ (L81.080)

While there is no morphological difference between futures and imperatives, impressionistically there is an intonational difference. Future declarative verbs have regular declarative intonation, while imperative constructions start higher and have a sharply falling intonation contour on the verb. However, I have no recorded imperative verbs which clearly show this. The impression of intonational difference comes from observations of imperatives directed at speakers (including myself), while the imperatives in my recordings are either part of narratives, and do not differ in intonation from the rest of the utterance, or are part of larger clauses where an object or adverb takes the sentence focus, which obscures the intonation on the verb.

5.2. Prohibitions
Prohibitions usually take the irrealis preﬁx and future or null (present) sufﬁx. They appear with the regular negator particle arra and have regular (not

630 Intra-clausal Syntax

future/imperative) second person marking.

(15.83)

i-n-joo-n=in.

3-TR-do/say-REM.PST=3M.IO

‘“Don’t be frightened of me,” he said.’

(L83.010)

The constituent order of prohibitions often has the verb in initial position. I assume this is because the negated action is in focus. However, other constituents may also receive identiﬁcation focus and may appear in initial position in both positive and negative imperatives, as example (15.83b) illustrates.

6. Causatives

Bardi has no morphological causative marking apart from the complex predicate construction which pairs adjectives with the light verb -ma- ‘make’; this was discussed above in §13.9.3.1; some other complex predicates form unproductive pairs (such as -jiidi- ‘go’ and -inya- ‘catch’) where the transitive member of the pair is the causative and the intransitive is an anticausative. Verbs which allow quasi-passive constructions with low-animacy causers (as discussed in §12.5) also sometimes appear in attempts to elicit causatives, as in (15.84).

(AKL-GDL/1)

Causatives 631

There is no productive syntactic means of deriving causatives of verbs. They never appear in texts, and both Aklif’s and my attempts to elicit constructions of this type were unsuccessful. All such English sentences were rephrased in a way that catches the sense of the utterance, without using a causative construction. Some examples of English prompts and their Bardi translations are given in (15.85).

Chapter 16 Clause Combining

1. Overview
In this ﬁnal chapter, I discuss different ways in which clauses may be combined, and may show dependencies between one another. I discuss the evidence for syntactic clausal embedding in the language, ﬁnite and non-ﬁnite subordination strategies, and the role of case marking in signaling subordination.

1.1. Types of complex clauses

Bardi has both ﬁnite and nonﬁnite clausal dependency structures. Furthermore, while some structures are overtly marked by morphology or sentential clitics, others have no marking. Here I consider both conjunction and subordination. The relevant constructions found in Bardi are listed below:209

(16.1)

a. =min, =gid, =(j)amb, =(g)arra, =gorror ‘if’; Wackernagel clitics which mark clausal dependencies, but not necessarily subordination (see (16.2));
b. Words which introduce new clauses, including ginyinggon, ginyinggarra, and ginyinggo (all roughly ‘and then’), and, in the Laves corpus (1920s) only, ranana ‘straightaway’ (see §16.3);
c. Conjunctions: agal ‘and’, man ‘but’, =barda ‘or’ and arragorror ‘but, or’;
d. Apposition and serialization; null marking (for causes, reasons, simultaneous action, or sequential/consecutive action; see §16.5);
e. =b(a), a Wackernagel clitic which primarily translates relative clauses; see (16.93) and §16.7;
f. Case markers, including the purposive -ngan and the semblative -marr ‘when’ (with ﬁnite or non-ﬁnite clauses; see e.g. §16.6);
g. Verb morphology; the simultaneous action marker -j ‘while Xing’ (discussed in §11.2.7 above).

634 Clause Combining
Data for investigation of these structures comes from both textual/narrative and conversational data, and elicitation. Elicitation was particularly crucial in discovering potential differences between covert conjunction, serialization, and subordination. I stress this because of a recent tendency in grammar writing to avoid such data in favor of pauses and intonation contours (see for example Kruspe 2004:339ff). Such data can also be revealing but are unlikely to reveal concrete differences between serialization and embedding.
1.2. Adjoined ‘relative’ clauses
Very inﬂuential in the study of subordination in Australian languages has been Hale’s (1976) study of Warlpiri clausal embedding, particularly in regards to what what he termed an ‘adjoined relative’ clause. Therefore, in order to situate the Bardi discussion more clearly in the Australian context, some background on this research is necessary (see also Nordlinger 2006a).210 Such clauses in Warlpiri frequently have the interpretation of relative clauses, but they are not embedded within a NP. Instead, they are peripheral in the clause. An example is given in (16.2):
(16.2) Warlpiri
Ngajulu-rlu=rna yankirri pantu-rnu, kuja=lpa ngapa 1SG-ERG=1SG.SUBJ emu spear-PAST, COMP=AUX water nga-rnu. drink-PAST
‘I speared the emu which was/while it was drinking water.’ (Hale 1976:78)
Two features of this construction are relevant here. The ﬁrst is the phrase structure. Hale (1976) argues Warlpiri adjoined relative clauses have the following structure:
(16.3) S dd
S REL
S

Overview 635
That is, the adjoined relative is a full clause which is embedded under an S node, but is an adjunct to the main clause. Adjoined relatives in Warlpiri must appear peripherally to the main clause. Note that this structure is distinct from a paratactic clause; Hale is clear that he does not consider adjoined relatives in Warlpiri to be paratactic.
The second feature is semantic interpretation. Such clause pairs usually have a coreferential argument, but (unlike true nominal relative clauses) they need not. They are also ambiguous in interpretation between relative clauses and temporal clauses, as shown by the gloss in (16.2) above. It seems that the marker of adjunction functions to designate a relation of coreference or cotemporality between the clauses.
Similar constructions are found in many parts of Australia, although they are not the only type of relativization or subordination strategy. For example, there are languages with switch reference marking (Austin 1988), with relative clauses marked by pronouns (e.g. in the YolNu bloc), and with subordination marked by nominalization.
As Nordlinger (2006a) has pointed out, the analysis of Warlpiri in Hale (1976) has been presumed to apply to a wide variety (and the majority) of Australian languages. That is, it has been largely assumed that Australian languages have a single multifunctional type of clause combing, in which the secondary clause is not truly embedded, but rather ‘syntactically marginal to the main clause’ (Nordlinger 2006a:1); Nordlinger also highlights how inﬂuential Hale’s article has been in interpretations of Australian subordination, and how it has led to an erroneous but nonetheless widespread perception that Australian languages do not exhibit syntactic embedding. Bardi provides another example of a language which challenges this view.
1.3. Bardi and adjunction
On currently available data, it is difﬁcult to determine whether ‘subordinate’ clauses in Bardi represent true subordination, or are rather adjoined to the main clause, as Hale (1976) claimed for Warlpiri. On the one hand, we have clear information about six different strategies to relate clauses together; these were listed in (16.1). Such clauses vary extensively in terms of marking, ﬁniteness, argument sharing, possibilities for constituent interleaving, and function. Clauses introduced by full words (see (16.1b)), for example, never show interleaving; neither do clauses introduced with clausal Wackernagel

636 Clause Combining

clitics (16.1a). Such clauses are related in larger discourse chunks, but do not need to share arguments. Clauses conjoined with the conjunctions agal ‘and’ and arragorror ‘or’ show a closer degree of nexus, but are still both fully ﬁnite, and need not share arguments. They also show no constituent interleaving.
As nexus becomes tighter (in (16.1d)–(16.1g) above), the distinction between paratactic and hypotactic constructions becomes harder to deﬁne.211 To illustrate the problem, consider complex sentences in (16.4).

(16.4) Ginyinggi ngaarri injalijjarrngayoo boogoonb inin.

Booroo nga-n-jala-gal=joogarra, boogoon=jamb look 1-TR-see-REC.PST=2AUG.IO inside=THUS goo-rr-i-n-kal. 2-AUG-sit-REC.PST

‘When I looked around for you, I saw you inside.’

The sentences in (16.4)–(16.6) would appear to point to an adjoined analysis. In (16.4), for example, the antecedent of the ‘relative’ clause boogoon=b

Overview 637

i-ni-n is ginyinggi ngaarri, which is initial in the clause and the subject of the verb (while the relative clause is ﬁnal); we might want to analyze this as a case of switch reference, or translate the sentence paratactically as ‘the ngaarri devil saw me, the one which lives in the mangroves’. However, note that ginyinggi ngaarri is not marked for ergative case. If this were an instance of clause chaining we would not expect the ergative to be omitted. However, we do regularly ﬁnd the ergative dropped from the antecedents of relative clauses (see further below).
Another problem with the ‘adjoined’ relative clause analysis is that there are some examples of sentences which appear to have interleaved ‘subordinate’ clauses. Consider (16.7) from the Laves corpus:

(16.7) Gooyarra arra irrmoonggoon ingarrjimbina nyoonoo ingarramarnirr aambanim malgin nyini irr.

Gooyarra arra irr-moonggoon i-ng-arr-jimbi-na nyoonoo

2

die

here

i-ng-arr-a-ma-rn=irr aamba-nim malgin nyini irr.

put

man-ERG in.secret here 3AUG

‘They didn’t know that two [men] had died and a man had been put

there hidden.’

(Laves n.d.:103/72)

The phrase gooyarra ‘two’ is the subject of ingarrjimbina, but the main clause, arra irrmoonggoon, intervenes. Therefore either gooyarra has raised out of the subordinate clause, or it is the object of irrmoonggoon, and the sentence should more literally be translated ‘they didn’t know the two, [that] they had died’. This is rather unlikely, however, as irrmoonggoon does not usually take a nominal complement, and if it does, it appears with the allative case. If this were ‘adjunction’, we would not expect to ﬁnd constituents of one clause in the middle of the other. Such examples are consistent with an analysis where elements of a lower clause can be focused at the front of a higher clause, however. The presence of interleaving of this type is thus a strong argument for subordination.
A further piece of information speaks in favor of an adjoined analysis, however. The relevant clauses have similar ambiguities in interpretation to the clauses which led Hale (1976) to argue for an adjoined analysis for Warlpiri. That is, many Bardi sentences are ambiguous between readings with coreferential arguments and temporal readings where no argument coreference is assumed. This is discussed further in §16.7 below.

638 Clause Combining

2. Clausal clitics

2.1. List of clitics

The clause chaining particles in my data were listed above in Table 14.6; they are repeated below for convenience in Table 16.1. There can only be a single clausal clitic in each clause (though there may be other clitics of other types within a single clause).

Bardi
=min =gid =b(a) =gorror =(j)amb =(g)ard(a) =(b)ard(a)

English

Further discussion of these items follows, with the exception of =(b)a, which is discussed in §16.7 below. It is also listed here, however, since it does have uses in marking clausal relations:

(16.8) Ingorrbooloon balab ginyinggi banyjoordoo, oolab inarnajirr.

balab ginyinggi banyjoordoo, o˙ola=b

i-n-ar-na=jirr.

3-TR-pierce-REM.PST=3A.IO

‘Banyjoord root (Tephrosa sp.) grows when it rains.’ (L77.007)

In (16.8), for example, there is no shared argument between the two clauses. Instead, the relation is one of cause and effect. More information is given below.
There are two words for ‘if’: arragorror, which is a separate word which appears ﬁrst in the clause, and =gorror, a second position clitic. Arragorror is presumably a compound of the clitic and the negator arra. For convenience, both these forms are discussed together with the conjunction agal ‘and’ in

Clausal clitics 639
the following section on conjunctions. Finally, =garda and =barda are also found as independent words (though they may cliticize at both the phrasal and the clausal level) and are discussed in §15.4.1.

2.2. Functions of clitics

2.2.1. =min and =gid

The two most common second position clause chaining clitics are =min and =gid. The difference between the two is slight, and speakers very often substitute one for the other when repeating clauses in transcription. They are both glossed here as ‘then’.
From consideration of the forms in the corpus, =gid advances the narrative. That is, it is used when events occur in a sequence, and the speaker is marking that the events are progressing from one to the other. (16.9) shows a typical stretch of Bardi narrative with clauses linked by the clitic =gid ‘then’.

(16.9) Bardagid angarrananirr niimanangarr aarli baalingan. Angarramarrananagidirr, moorrgardagid daag angirrinan.

Barda=gid a-ng-arr-a-na-n=irr

‘We used to go home with lots of ﬁsh. We used to cook them, and

we used to go to sleep with a full stomach.’

(AYI1.9-10)

The second clitic, =min, is used for actions which are closely linked in some way. Rather than advancing the narrative to the next scene, as =gid does, =min focuses on the link between the =min-marked clause and what follows. An example is given in (16.10). Clauses are bracketed, and =min attaches to the end of the ﬁrst word of the clause.

‘Then, when they had collected plenty they went back, to give this meat to all the people, and they slept again at Boolnginy.’(NAA.008)

The contexts in which =min most often appears are also in narrative advances, and sentences marked with =min also often have a change of topic. In this, the function of =min shows some overlap with that of =gid.
Both these markers are common in my and Gedda Aklif’s materials, and appear also in the texts of C. D. Metcalfe. They are, however, quite rare in the Laves materials, with only about ﬁve examples of each in the entire corpus. Other discourse connectors (most notably ginyinggon ‘then’) appear in the materials instead.
Example (16.11) shows another feature of clause connectors in Bardi: two clause chainers are possible if one is a full word such as ginyinggon. In this

Clausal clitics 641

example, ginyinggon does not make position for the clitic hosting; it is presumably parenthetical or extra-clausal in this example. In other cases, however, examples of ginyinggon=min are found, as in (16.12).

2.2.2. =(j)amb ‘thus’, ‘that’s why’

This clitic has forms both with and without its initial stop. Broadly, =(j)amb is used to denote a causal relation between one sentence and the next. Most commonly, it is used to explain why a state of affairs obtains:

‘I ate bad food and that’s why I vomited.’

Most of the examples in the corpus are of this type. Related to this is the word ginyinggamb ‘that’s why’, which is historically the third person minimal pronoun with =jamb. It always occurs ﬁrst in the clause:

(16.18) Gorna ngangimiligal jalbany, goolarlamb nganjoo booljarrjangarr. Ginyinggamb nganin ilogo.

‘I woke up this morning feeling good, all of a sudden I felt weak for no reason. That’s why I am lying down.’

The reason clause (marked with =jamb) is often second, following the other clause. All the examples given above are of that structure. It is also possible, however, for the clauses to occur in the opposite order, with the =jamb-marked clause appearing before its clause pair, as in (16.19):

1-AUG-eat-CONT=THUS 3A.POSS egg good 3A-taste

‘[These eagles make their nest on top of the rocks.] We eat their eggs. They taste good.’

There are other uses of =jamb, however, which do not ﬁt these patterns. One case is where the causal relation between the two sentences does not appear to be particularly strong. In (16.20), for example, the ﬁrst clause says that the aanyjoo (Glycine sp.) yams are associated with (and only found on) the mainland. The next clauses talk about how mainland people cook and eat these yams, but the cooking and eating is not causally linked to the yams being found on the mainland, since islanders also cook and eat yams in this way (although not aanyjoo yams).

(16.20)

hot.sand-LOC sand 3-AUG-cook-CONT=THUS

‘Anyjoo yams are from the mainland and they eat them on the mainland. They cook them in the hot sand.’

Another exceptional use is where the clitic is used in a free-standing clause. In some cases, the implication of ‘that’s why’ still ﬁts. In (16.21), for example, there is another word, the adverb amarda, which also carries the same meaning.

(16.21)

“Amarda biini minangga doombarr ingirrinya garrabaljamb,” ingirri.

‘“You stank, that’s why the birds ﬂew away,” they said.’ (L71.018)

644 Clause Combining

In other cases, however, the causal meaning is absent. In (16.22), =jamb has no causal connection to the preceding clause.

(16.22) Gaanygayoonamb banyjoord.
Gaanyga-yoon=amb banyjoord. mainland-SOURCE=THUS ﬁsh.poison

‘[Banyjoord poison root (Tephrosa sp.) is used for scattering in crevices of reefs so that the ﬁsh die.] It’s from the mainland.’

The clitic can be used on two (or more) clauses, where the meaning is something like ‘when . . . then’.

‘This (green) fruit is called gamaloon; we pick them in January and eat them.’

In some of the older texts, multiple clauses are marked with =jamb. I assume that in such cases, the clitic reinforces the idea of connection between all the events in each clause; that is, that the events are all sub-events in a larger context.

Clausal clitics 645

There are a few uses of =jamb which are either not second position, or where the item to which the clitic is attached is extraposed in some way. In (16.21), for example, garrabal=jamb ‘bird=THUS’ shows that =jamb is not attaching in second position in the discourse. Further examples follow.

(16.25) Arinyjinan raanana liyannga ingarramana mayingan ginyinggi maya goolngarrinyjamba ninga agal irrilma biila.

‘In another oolooloong [ceremony] they become gambil boys (when they get the hand strings).’

I have no explanation for this use of =jamb. It is possible that such examples show extraposed items, or that there is a different use of =jamb which is phrase-bound rather than clause-bound. Unfortunately, audio recordings of these items are not available, so we cannot diagnose from intonation whether the phrase aron oolooloong is extraposed, or a different clause.
In both the Laves materials and in the modern corpus, jamb appears a few times as ﬁrst in the clause as a free-standing word. In such cases, it appears to mean something like ‘therefore’.

There are also three examples in the phrase Jamb gala, which speakers gloss as ‘well then’.

(MLL1.026)

2.3. Placement of clitics
While the generalization that the clitic occurs in second position is a robust one, there is some variation in what can ‘count’ as second position for this purpose. Most often, the second position clitic occurs after the ﬁrst phonological word in the clause. That is, the clausal clitic is sensitive to wordhood and not phrasehood.
Occasionally, however, there is more material than a single phonological word as host for the clitic. Such phrases always comprise a pronominal item and a noun, or a preverb and inﬂecting verb. In (16.30), for example, ginyinggon boor(oo) is a single noun phrase.

‘That’s why people get ﬁsh poison in that place today.’

Such examples are very rare, however, and speakers judge such phrases as ungrammatical when presented with them in isolation. That is not true of the preverb + inﬂecting verb pairs, however, which are grammatical as a multiword host for clitics. This was discussed above in §13.2.2.
When the verb is the ﬁrst item in the clause (and thus the host for the clitic), the sentential clitic precedes any other clitics on the verb; that includes agreement clitics.

3. Words which introduce new clauses
In addition to the sentential clitics, certain full words are used to signal the relations between clauses. I have avoided the term ‘complementizer’, although they show many features of this word class, for two reasons. First is that most

648 Clause Combining

of the items listed here are either transparently case-marked forms of pronouns (though they have a distribution and function which is distinct from pronouns), or they are indistinguishable from adverbs. Furthermore, I have little information on the syntax of clauses marked by these words; for example, I do not know whether they form syntactic islands, or how similar their syntax is to complex clauses in more familiar languages. In some cases (such as with the word ginyinggon ‘then’), it is fairly clear that the dependency between clauses is pragmatic rather than syntactic. That is, the speaker is drawing a connection in discourse between two events, but the clauses are free-standing. In other cases, it is more difﬁcult to tell.
In the modern language, the most common of these words is ginyinggon ‘then’ (the locative of the third person minimal pronoun, so literally ‘at that’) or ginyinggarra, which also means ‘then’. In the Laves corpus besides ginyinggon we frequently ﬁnd ranan or raana ‘straightaway’.212 These clause chainers have a number of forms, including apparently ablative and locative case marked forms, as well as ginyinggarra; -garra is a common temporal marker in the other Nyulnyulan languages but it is not otherwise found in Bardi except in fossilized phrases.213 In the other languages, karra or -karr has a subordinating function.

The words which may act as clause connectors and appear in initial or second position in the clause are given in Table 16.2. A few forms alternate between initial position and second position clitics. Forms based on the third person minimal pronoun ginyingg were illustrated in (16.32) through (16.34) and since numerous other examples appear throughout the grammar, they are not further discussed here.

3.1. ‘Until, yet, still’: gardi
There are a couple of initial clause chaining items in addition to ginyinggon. Such clauses are probably not strictly subordinate, in that they have a different type of intonation, denoted here by the comma between the clauses. The word gardi ‘still’ is probably an adverb, but it can also be used to introduce clauses which are connected to preceding discourse.

650 Clause Combining

The ﬁrst use of gardi is ‘until’. Gardi introduces a clause which indicates the point at which the previous action ceases.

(16.35)

a. Goorr ingarra gaara, gardi ingirriidingirr. Goorr i-ng-a-rr-a gaara, gardi i-ng-irr-iidi-ng=irr. poke they-poked-it sand until they-touched-them

‘I was lost until they looked for me.’

Such examples often alternate in translation with clauses introduced by ginyinggon. For example, (16.35a) was also given as (16.36).

3-PST-AUG-touch=3A.DO turtle.egg

‘They poked the sand (with a stick) till they found turtle eggs.’

There are other uses of gardi, which are illustrated in (16.37). In such sentences, there is still a connection to the previous (or in some cases, the following) clause, but the meaning is not one in which the clause with gardi delimits the action of the other clause. In (16.37), gardi rather means ‘still’; that is, it refers to actions or states which persist, despite the action of the previous clause.

(JLN2.005)

In (16.37a), for example, the meaning of the sentence is not that they fought until they were uninjured, but rather, despite the fact that they fought, they remained unhurt.

3.2. Gardamb(a) ‘hardly’

A word related to gardi is gardamba, which means ‘hardly’ or ‘it hardly matters, it doesn’t matter’. Note that not all examples of gardamba in the corpus have this meaning, since gardamba can also be compositional, with =jamb ‘thus’ cliticized to gardi ‘still’. It can be used both as a clause connector and on its own (as in (16.38a)).

3.3. Ngoonjoon ‘since’

Ngoonjoon ‘since’ is unlike the other items discussed here, in that it only combines with other complementizers. That is, it never appears alone. It would perhaps be better described as an adverb (or even perhaps as a nascent adposition), but it is listed here since its function is similar to gardi ‘until’ and other clause combiners.

(16.39) Ginyinggo ngoonjoon oola ingarrananan joodinygo inanggalboon oola gardamb ingarranan biidininyarr oola.

Further examples with ngoonjoon as a phrasal adverb were given above in §5.4.5.2.6 and §14.2.1.

3.4. ‘If’: (=)gorror and arragorror
There are three (related) ways of saying ‘if’ in Bardi. The ﬁrst is the clitic =gorror. It does not lenite, unlike the clitic modality =garda, and it may

Words which introduce new clauses 653

appear either as a clitic or as a separate word (where it also appears in second position). An example of a typical sentence is given in (16.40).

(16.40) Injanboon gorror amboorinynim gardimb ngarri amba iiga indan niimbala.

‘If a person steps on one of those protrusions [on the reef], it makes your foot very sore.’

A form gorr has also been recorded in this meaning. It could be a fast speech or conversational variant of gorror.

(16.41) Liyan gorr injiidinganjoogarr barnanggarr arra joogarr liyan joodinyko gornamba.

‘If He [Jesus] touches your heart today/when he touched your heart, it won’t be your heart (anymore) for ever, and that’s good.’
(BE: CB52.1)

Secondly, the word gorror is used used in conjunction with =jamb in the construction ‘if . . . then’. Typical examples are given in (16.42).

Note that the placement of gorror with respect to the ﬁrst person direct object clitic =ngay in (16.43), which shows an example of gorror as an independent word. If it were a clausal clitic in this example (like =gard or =min), it would precede the direct object marker. (16.44) shows a clitic use of =gorror; an independent word would not attach onto the preverb in this way. Only clitics may intervene between a preverb and the associated light verb.

(LIZ2.003)

All the examples of conditional sentences in my corpus are simple conditions; that is, they involve a protasis (marked by gorror) and an apodosis. They are all in present or past tense, except for negative sentences which appear in the irrealis, as expected:

(16.45) Arra gorror jina irrola ilngamoong orronyirr.

‘Next time, if you come back, visit your grandfather and bring some turtle for him.’

Thirdly, arragorror, a combination of gorror and the negator arra, is used. (Note that there are also instances of arra and gorror used as separate words, as in (16.42) above.) Arragorror is also a possible translation of ‘or’, for which see below.

3.5. Galnga ‘even though, although’
The word galnga was not accepted by all speakers (Bessie Ejai, for example, did not think it was real Bardi), but it appears in some of the older materials and in elicitation with other speakers, as a way to form concessive clauses.

(Metcalfe 1975a)

In most of the few examples I have, the concessive clause precedes the other clause, as shown here; (16.47) shows an example in the opposite order. (16.49) shows that galnga may also host the relator marker. Galnga is always ﬁrst in its clause.

4. Conjunctions
Bardi has four items which have the function of conjunctions: agal ‘and’, =barda ‘or’, =gorror (and derivatives such as arragorror) ‘or (also if; see above)’, and man ‘but’. Each has slightly different syntax. The ﬁrst is a full word which most often occurs between the two elements being conjoined,

Conjunctions 657

though it can also occasionally start sentences. Arragorror is also a free word, which may occur in second position, or between the elements being conjoined. It is transparently the negator arra and the clitic =gorror ‘if’. =Gorror itself is a second position clitic, as is =barda. The third word, man, is an independent word which may occur in ﬁrst or second position. Discussion of each follows.
It should be noted that there is also conjunction by ‘juxtaposition’ at both the phrasal and the clausal level. The two conjoined elements do not have to be adjacent to each other, as in (16.50), where there are two comitativemarked phrases, which are not adjacent, and which show no overt markers of conjunction.

(16.50) Arra jiiwanyarra oolarrmonyjin irrolinyarr gardi layib irrgoordoo.

‘No one died by spearing or by boomerang; they were all still

healthy.’

(L110.007)

4.1. ‘And’: agal

The word agal is a conjunction which joins phrases or clauses. That is, it can be used to join noun phrases or verbs (examples of this were provided in Chapter 8). In clause linkage, agal appears at the beginning of the second clause. Both clauses are fully ﬁnite. Agal does not take a stress. Bardi has monosyndetic coordination (that is, a single coordinator; see further Haspelmath 2004:4).

(16.51) Gala inggardinijin booroo, injalgoon gajoordoon boogoon, nimala minyjin agal boor injalana liyanngan minyjin gajoordoon boogoon, gala inyjalgoon.

‘He jumped into the ashes, buried himself in it with only his nose

sticking out for breathing, and he looked around for the spirit. He

was already hiding inside the ashes.’

(BMF.007)

The word agal is only used monosyndetically in Bardi, not bisyndetically (such as to mark ‘both . . . and’ constructions; biila ‘also’ is used in that case).
Multiple conjunction is permitted at the phrase level; there are no examples of agal being used to chain multiple clauses. Multiple clause chaining is achieved through parataxis.

‘You mustn’t eat molon (giant trevally), garaginya (unidentiﬁed ﬁsh species), goolarrji (Spanish mackerel), or gambarl (surgeon ﬁsh).’
(L145.022)

Notice in example (16.52) that agal is used to coordinate items under the scope of negation.
Agal can conjoin elements in verbless clauses:

(16.53) Garrgarr jiidag oolardangan agal noorroongan.
Garrgarr jiidag o˙olarda-ngan agal no˙orroo-ngan. climbing.vines strap coolamon-ALL and torch-ALL

‘Climbing vines (Gymnanthera nitida) are [used as] straps for coola-

mons and for torches.’

(BBG.44–45)

Finally, agal is used in giving choices, where English would use the word ‘or’:

‘A long time ago, people used to stay indoors, in their huts or in

(CYC2.007)

4.2. Or
Just as in the case of translations of English ‘and’, there are several ways to translate the word ‘or’, to mark choices and alternatives. Australian languages are sometimes said to lack a word for ‘or’, instead expressing such concepts either with juxtaposition or with the same word as is used for conjunction with ‘and’. Bardi has both of those mechanisms, but it also has a distinct Bardi word, =gorror, as well as having borrowed the word ‘or’ from English.

4.2.1. Juxtaposition

The ﬁrst (and most common) is to use two clauses or phrases juxtaposed to one another.

4.2.2. =Bard(a)

The second way to signal choices is to use the polar interrogative clitic =bard(a). It appears bisyndetically, that is, on each element to be chosen from. This may also be used on either phrases or clauses; see further §15.4.1.

4.2.3. Arragorror ‘or’
My only examples for arragorror as a phrasal disjoint conjunction are from an elicitation session in 2001 with Jessie Sampi. However, the data gathered there were quite consistent. In all examples, arragorror either appears between the two items to be conjoined, or at the end of the sentence, with one of the items fronted. Examples of both appear below.

The English word or is also used on occasion in Bardi, where it is pronounced [O] or [Oô]. In Australian English, ‘or’ receives an epenthetic rhotic when the following word begins with a vowel. I have spelled it the same way as in English, since it is compatible with Bardi orthography; Aklif spells it as o, which is closer to the typical pronunciation. I have retained the source spelling here.

Unlike the other conjunctions, man is used only for clauses; it is not used for phrase conjunction.

Null-marked clause chaining and verb serialization 663

5. Null-marked clause chaining and verb serialization

5.1. Arguments for serialization

In textual data one frequently ﬁnds series of clauses which are clearly closely related but which show no overt markers for conjunction or subordination. In (16.63), for example, there are three verbs. The ﬁrst two, nganjarrga ‘I ask’ (uninﬂected for tense) and nganjoogaljirri ‘I said to you’ are probably appositive, i.e. ‘I ask(ed), I said to you . . . ’. The ‘subordinate’ clause, ‘if you would give me money’, also has no overt marking of subordination and could be appositive.214

(16.63) Nganjangarrga nganjoogaljirri goolboo nganyji anangay.

nganyji a-n-a=ngay.

INTERROG 2-TR-give-FUT=1M.DO

‘I was going to ask if you would give me money.’

Frequently, the same subject is retained across clauses. In (16.64), for example, there are no intonation breaks between the verbs and they form a single large prosodic unit. However, subject retention is not obligatory, as seen from (16.63), for example.

(16.64) Ginyinggon roowil innyana Ngarrigoonbooroo baalingan darr inarnajirri niimana aamba agal ambooriny Ngoolbirndi.

‘Then Ngarrigoonbooroo walked to her camp and came across

many people at Ngoolbirndi.’

(Laves n.d.:129/19)

These multiple verbs have many of the characteristics of discourse serialization (for the term see Pawley and Lane 1998). This is a type of serialization where multiple verb phrases can appear in a single clause. They occur

664 Clause Combining

in a single intonation contour (although there are also examples with breaks, and examples where intonation units and syntactic units are not isomorphic). They often have the same tense/aspect/mood marking (at least in the preﬁxal component of the TAM marking), but I have not tested this systematically. Finally, such structures are very frequent in texts and conversation, but almost entirely absent from elicited data. Bardi does not have other types of serialization (such as manner or nuclear serialization). Bardi is thus an exception to Baker’s (1989) claim that languages with morphological tense marking do not exhibit serialization Baker (1989:141).
There is some evidence that Bardi has both subordination (or serialization) and parataxis. In some cases the presence or absence of overt nominal material appears to be grammatically constrained. In the following Bardi sentence the noun oorany is not omissible:

(16.65) Jaarla nganjalagal *(oorany) wiliwilon inkalgal.

Jaarla

nga-n-jala-gal *(oorany) wiliwil-on

beach(ø-loc) 1M-TR-see-PST woman ﬁshing

i-n-kal-gal.

3M-TR-visit-REC.PST.

‘I saw a woman on the beach, she was ﬁshing.’ / ‘I saw the woman ﬁshing on the beach.’

However, the sentence without oorany is grammatical as true parataxis, with a pause between the clauses. We might then wish to conclude that serialization is only possible with overt shared arguments. However, many conversational and textual examples argue against such a conclusion. Examples such as (16.66) are very common. This example is structurally parallel to (16.65), except the argument which is coreferential to both clauses does not appear as a free noun phrase.

(16.66) Iyi, booroo nganjalagal morrgoon inkalgal.
Iyi, booroo nga-n-jala-gal morr-goon i-n-kal-gal. yes, see 1-TR-see-REC.PST street-LOC 3-TR-wander-REC.PST

‘I saw it walking in the street.’

(NI/CB.07)

A further piece of evidence shows that these clauses are joined in a single higher structure rather than chained without embedding. It is possible to extract constituents from a lower clause into a higher clause. If the clauses are

Null-marked clause chaining and verb serialization 665
conjoined, this should not be possible, since conjunction is a strong barrier to extraction (see further Roeper 2011, following Ross 1967). For examples see (16.7) above and (16.89) below.
Thus, while there is evidence that the clauses in such constructions are not conjoined with a null conjunction, I do not have sufﬁcient evidence at present to distinguish serialization from subordination consistently. This is a topic for future research.

5.2. Functions of clause chaining
I follow McGregor (in press) in identifying three distinct ways in which null marked clause chaining is used. McGregor deﬁnes three functions of null clause chaining in Nyulnyul: extension (that is, coordination of several events or subsevents), elaboration (afterthought-type constructions), and enhancement, which provides more information about a single event. This typology also describes Bardi clause chaining. These functions are described in the following sections. I also recognize a fourth type of clause chaining: indirect speech, which McGregor does not discuss for Nyulnyul.

5.2.1. Extension (coordination)

In the ﬁrst (and very common) case, the clause chaining targets sequences of events. In such cases, the order of the clauses reﬂects the order of the actions.

(16.67) Innyana gooljoo boo inamana.

I-n-nya-na

gooljoo bo˙o i-na-ma-na.

3-TR-pick-REM.PST grass blow 3-TR-put-REM.PST

‘He picked grass and blew on it (as part of making a ﬁre).’ (GGG.012)

In other cases, the actions described in the clauses are simultaneous rather than consecutive. (16.68), for example, describes a method of catching ﬁsh where ﬁsh are corralled in a large ﬁsh trap as the tide goes out. (16.69) is another type of ‘simultaneous’ action, where the ﬁrst clause is a verb of perception and the second clause describes what the person saw.

‘He saw something fall from high up, from that tree down to the

(BMF.004)

(16.70) illustrates a further point about clause chaining constructions: they interact with null marking. Recall from §15.1.2 that the ﬁnal position in the clause is a (reintroduced) topic position; that is, topics which persist in discourse are often omitted, but when they are overt, they are usually ﬁnal in the clause (see also Bowern (2008a) for discussion). This generalization holds across serialized clauses too.

Null-marked clause chaining and verb serialization 667
Note also that (16.70) shows that arguments need not maintain the same grammatical role across serialized verbs. The subject of the ﬁrst clause is the object of all subsequent clauses. (The subject of the subsequent clauses, a ngaarri spirit, is inferred from discourse.)
5.3. Elaboration (afterthoughts)
Bardi has an afterthought construction. These have a rather different intonation contour from the extension serialization clauses described in §16.5.2.1 above. Afterthought constructions are characterized by a secondary rise in pitch on the ﬁrst part of the afterthought. Figure 16.1 shows the pitch track of the sentence in (16.71).

‘There was this man. He was a young boy, not a grown man.’ (BMF.01–02)

668 Clause Combining
Here there are two afterthought clauses, part of a text by Nancy Isaac. The structure of the extract is as follow. The speaker begins with the text with aamba ginyingg ‘this man/boy’ (the one we’ve just been talking about and who is now going to feature in the story). She then begins barda nyoon ‘then..’, and interrupts this to say wangalang aamb ‘young man’, arra boordiji ‘not a grown man’. The word wangalang has a high pitch peak, while arra has a secondary (but still substantial) peak as well. In regular declarative intonation, a phrase arra boordiji ‘not big’ would normally have the peak on the content word rather than the negator.
Further examples of noun phrases which appear as afterthought constructions were given in §8.3.2 above.

5.4. Enhancement and elaborative chaining

The third type of clause chaining in the corpus is where the subsequent clauses provide additional information about the ﬁrst. Semantically, such clauses are somewhat similar to afterthought constructions, though they have different intonation. The intonation contour of such clauses is more similar to extension clause chains, where all the verbs are under a single intonational curve that peaks on the ﬁrst word of the clause (that is, the item in focus) and which then falls towards the end of the clause.

5.5. Indirect speech

The fourth type of clause chaining involves indirect speech (including indirect questions), thought, or feeling. Clause chaining of this type is also used with the noun ‘knowledge’, as in example (16.76).

670 Clause Combining

Syntactically, there does not seem to be much difference between clauses in direct speech and their indirect counterparts. In terms of constituency, for example, the same word order principles apply to indirect speech clauses. Indirect questions do not receive the same interrogative intonation patterns as the direct questions, however, which provides evidence for a difference in construction. Evidence that these are indirect speech clauses, and not paratactic clauses with quoted questions, comes from agreement patterns. Examples such as (16.77) show that the question is a reporting of speech, not direct speech. If this example had direct speech, we would expect the verb oonka to be second person and of the form ana (‘tell the man: [you] bring me food’) rather than third person.

(16.77)

Nganyji barni minjoogaljin aamba mayi oonka?

(BE: CB08.5/20)

In these clauses, arguments of the lower verb can be extracted and focused in initial position. That is, the two clauses act as a single constituent for the purposes of determining ‘initial’ position. In (16.78b), for example, baawanim ‘child-ERG’ is the subject of the second verb ingarrarligal ‘they ate’. It is marked with ergative case. If baawanim were the subject of the ﬁrst verb anjilnga, the sentence would mean ‘let you (a child) say that they ate a lot of bread.’

‘They didn’t know if he’d gone back or was still out there.’ (L155.021)

Some of these constructions alternate with clauses marked by gerunds, which are described in the following section.

6. Gerundial complement clauses
Bardi has a several constructions in which gerunds (see §11.3) occur with a ﬁnite verb. They occur as the complements of ‘know’ and ‘like’ constructions, for example, where they are an alternative option to fully ﬁnite clauses. They also occur with the allative case in marking purpose clauses, and as a complement of arranga ‘without’.

6.1. Perception and emotion complements

Four items of perception and emotion are attested as being able to take gerunds as complements. They are given in (16.80).

(16.80)

a. liyan -ma- ‘like’ b. +oongoong -ma- (or alone without a light verb) ‘like’ c. +moonggoon ‘know’ (and derived complex predicates such as
+moonggoon -ma- ‘teach’) d. -jargi- ‘fear’

The ﬁrst of these is a complex predicate with the verb ‘put’. The words +oongoong ‘stomach’ and +moonggoon ‘know’ are nouns which are inﬂected for inalienable possession. The last, -jargi- ‘fear’, is a ﬁnite verb. In all cases, the gerundial clause is marked with the allative case. In the examples below, this mostly occurs on the verb. If a non-verbal item is ﬁrst in the subordinate clause, it receives the allative and the verb would be a plain gerund (as in (16.84)).

6.2. Arranga ‘without’
As noted in §15.3 above, arranga ‘without’ can be used with either a nominal complement or a gerundial clause, as illustrated in (16.85).

(M1939A, p 3)

6.3. Purpose clauses

Finally, gerunds are used—again with the allative case—in purpose clauses. (16.86) provides an example where the speaker explains the use of an item.

(16.86) Iina noorrongan maloorroon. Iina no˙orro-ngan ma-loorroo-n. ﬁrestick ﬁre-ALL GER-light-CONT

‘Iina (ﬁresticks) are for lighting a ﬁre.’

7. Relative clauses
It might seem odd to place relative clauses in a chapter on clause combination, rather than in noun phrase syntax. Bardi relative clauses are not embedded within an NP; their syntax is not the same as true relative clauses. Nor, however, are they clearly paratactic to the main clause; there is a dependency between the two clauses and frequent coreference. Evidence from intonation and word order interleaving also strongly indicates that one clause is subordinated to the other, rather than adjoined to it.
Nyulnyulan relative clauses are heterogeneous. In Bardi, they are marked by =b(a), a morpheme which has no cognates in the rest of Nyulnyulan.215 In

674 Clause Combining
Warrwa, they are marked by -jarr- in the verb. The same morpheme in Bardi marks topic chaining; see §10.3.2. McGregor (1994a:35ff) treats this type of clause as an instance of subordination.

7.1. Form of the relative clause marker

Relative clauses in Bardi, as mentioned above, are marked by =b(a). The absence of lenition of b to w or ø provides evidence that this morpheme is a clitic rather than an afﬁx. It is encliticized to the ﬁrst word of the dependent clause which usually (but not exclusively) appears immediately following the relativized noun. When the host ends in a vowel, the form of the clitic is =b, as in (16.87). If the word ends in a consonant, the form is =ba. It is also usually a full syllable in the Laves texts, or if another clitic follows.

(16.87) Gorna goorlil layab irrgoordoo. Gorna goorlil laya=b irrgoordoo. good turtle fat=REL all.kinds

(16.88)

‘It was a good turtle, which had a lot of fat.’

(L78.006)

ceremony G=REL=3M.POSS ceremony

‘They all came to this side for the ilma ceremony, which was

Goolyi’s ilma.’

(L146.002)

If the host ends in a consonant or consonant cluster and the following word begins with a vowel, the relator marker may become a proclitic to the vowelinitial word (that is, the marker changes host). This is the only clitic with this behavior and the only example of a potential proclitic in the language.

7.2. Syntax of relative clauses
Relative clauses are postnominal. They may be restrictive or unrestrictive, and there are both headed and headless relative clause examples. The examples in (16.89) are typical. (16.90) is an example of a headless relative clause.

Relative clauses 675

‘Did you see [the person] who took my sugar?’

There are a couple of points to note about the sentences. The ﬁrst is that in these clauses, there is obligatory coreference between an argument in the main clause and an argument in the subordinate clause. Most examples involve subject relativization (as shown in (16.89)), but examples of relativization on other grammatical relations are also found. Examples of object relativization are given below. The example in (16.92) illustrates an important point about relative clauses in Australian languages in general. They almost never simply function as relative clauses. Rather, they are often used to translate simultaneous or subsequent actions, and sometimes consecutive actions, and sometimes they function more like switch reference markers.216

i-na-moogar-in-j.] 3-TRANS-make-CONT-SIMUL

‘I was watching the man who/as he made the boat.’ (AKL.F4)

This heterogeneity of function is part of Hale’s (1976) argument that such clauses are adjoined to the main clause rather than strictly dependent on the noun. That is, the relationship between such clauses is one of relations between events, rather than a strict marking of particular participants (see, e.g. Hale 1976:79). The =ba-marked clauses in Bardi are a single construction that subsumes more functions than relative clauses typically do. Hale (1976) notes that in Warlpiri the NP-relative interpretation of such clauses applies when there is a coreferential argument, and the T-relative interpretation when no arguments are shared between clauses. In Bardi, =b(a) is not used if there are no shared arguments; there are other dependency markers used in such cases, such as =jamb. However, relatives are still ambiguous between NPrelatives and T-relatives.
The sentences in (16.93)–(16.94) would also appear to point to an adjoined analysis. In (16.93), for example, the antecedent of the ‘relative’ clause boogoonb inin is ginyinggi ngaarri ‘that devil’, which is not adjacent to the relative clause. One might translate the clause as ‘the devil saw me, the one that lives in the mangroves.’ However, note that ginyinggi ngaarri is not marked for ergative case. If this were an instance of clause chaining, we would not expect the ergative to be omitted. However, we do regularly ﬁnd the ergative dropped from the antecedents of relative clauses (see further Bowern (2008e) and §5.3.1 for the relevant data). Ergative-marked subjects may be the antecedents of relative clauses, however such sentences are very rare in my corpus and are strongly dispreferred in elicitation. The simplest interpretation here is that the phrase ginyinggo ngaarri is a constituent in the relative clause which has been focused, and thus appears in initial position. This interpretation is only possible if the whole sentence in (16.93) is a single clause with embedding.

(16.93) Ginyinggi ngaarri injalijjarrngayoo boogoonb inin.

‘When you come back in the afternoon, you’ll see me there inside.’

In summary, Bardi relative clauses have a number of features of adjunction rather than embedded subordination. However, we also have cases where constituents are not clause bound, and such sentences point strongly towards an analysis of Bardi relatives as subordinated. Clausal embedding of this type is rare in Australia, although not unknown.217

7.3. Other functions of relative clauses
There are two other functions of the relative clause marker which are worth noting. They can appear in a few set phrases which have the form of headless relative clauses, but which are fossilized and which act as a single phrase. The most common is garndib inin, which is one of the ways of saying ‘God’.
(16.95) garndib inin
garndi=b i-ni-n above=REL 3-sit-cont
The interrogative pronoun anggaba ‘who’ probably also has this structure historically.218
The second use of relative clauses is in cleft constructions.

(L157.026)

7.4. Multiple relative clauses

Multiple relative markers are permitted in a single clause; they also appear with other subordination and clause chaining items. (16.98) provides an example with several relator markers. In the second example, a literal translation might be something like ‘teasing was that which was in return, and which was humbugging.’219

(16.98)

‘[He was still running away from nothing, and afraid of nothing.] As a result (in return) they humbugged and teased him.’(MET.p4)

Case marking and subordination 679

Another fairly common construction is the use of the relator =ba in conjunction with =jamb (for which see above).

(16.99) Gard injalalanjarrngay niimanab aarli injooloongan inanjamboongay.

Gard i-n-jalala-n=jarrngay

3-TR-collect-CONT 3-TR-give-CONT=1M.DO

‘He looks after me, (who) gets a lot of ﬁsh and thus gives them to me.’

8. Case marking and subordination

The ﬁnal area of clause combination to consider is the use of case on ﬁnite and non-ﬁnite clauses. Both structures exist in Nyulnyulan languages. In Nyulnyul, case marking on fully ﬁnite clauses is the preferred method of forming subordinate clauses. Case-marked clauses are also found in Bardi, although they are much less common. Most Bardi examples are found with gerunds rather than ﬁnite verbs, as in (16.100).

(16.100) Bijorro inalinygarnan wirrngan marrmin.
Bijorr-o i-n-alinygarna-n [wirr-ngan m-arrmi-n]. there-ABL 3-TR-try-cont lift-ALL GER-rise-CONT

‘From there, he tried to rise up (into the sky).’

(AKL)

In this sentence, there is a matrix verb, which is ﬁnite, another verb in a nonﬁnite form, and there is argument coreference (that is, the subject argument of the ﬁnite verb is shared by a notional subject of the nonﬁnite verb). There is overt marking of the dependency, in this case by the allative/purposive case marker -ngan.
Similar constructions are found in all Nyulnyulan languages. The most common cases used are the semblative, the proprietive (‘having’), the ablative, and the locative. (16.101) gives examples from Nyulnyul (McGregor 1994a, 1996b). However, in these languages, the verbs are usually ﬁnite. (In

680 Clause Combining

these examples I have replaced McGregor’s schematic glossing with glossing conventions used in this book.)

(16.101)

Nyulnyul: -uk ‘Locative’ a. i-m-bulkubulkum i-n-dam-uk=ngay
3-PST-swell 3-TR-hit-LOC=1M.DO ‘It swelled where he hit me.’ b. i-ngalk majikarr walk i-n-jarrjarr-uk 3-cry sunset sun 3-TR-stand-LOC ‘She cried from sunset to sunrise.’ lit: ‘She cried at sunset, to the sun’s rising.’

I have not recorded clauses of this type in Bardi. Given how common they are in other Nyulnyulan languages, their absence from my Bardi corpus is striking. Instead, Bardi uses either non-ﬁnite clauses or ﬁnite clauses introduced by a ‘linker’ such as ginyinggo, ginyinggon, ginyinggarra ‘then’ or a Wackernagel clitic, as discussed at the beginning this chapter.
There are just two instances where case occurs on ﬁnite forms in Bardi. The ﬁrst is that under highly restricted conditions, ﬁnite verbs can be inﬂected with the ergative case, in which case the meaning is ‘the one who does < verb>’. The only spontaneous example known to me is found in the Laves corpus.

Subsequent elicitation based on this sentence led speakers to give the forms inamboonanim ‘the one who hit it’, and injalananim ‘the one who saw it’ was also tentatively suggested. This is clearly a marginal construction in the language. Interestingly, of the case markers used in Nyulnyul to mark subordination, the ergative is not one of them.
The second use of case to mark ﬁnite subordination is more frequent. The semblative case -marr(a) can be used to mark ‘when’ clauses, for the time at which something happened. Example (16.103b) shows that semblative marking may co-occur with relative clause marking in such cases. Remember that marking occurs on the ﬁrst constituent of the clause; even though -marr here appears on the noun boordan ‘scrub’, the important point here is that the verb injoon is ﬁnite.

(16.103)

a. Nyoon injoonb boordanmarr injoon inaman iila.

Nyoon i-n-joo-n=b

iila.

3-TR-put-REM.PST dog

‘When he had done this, when he got into the scrub, he put down the dog [which he had been carrying].’ (DRK.080–81)

b. Baawanim inbirrilin irrol roowilmarrab innyan.

Baawa-nim i-n-birrili-n

irrol roowil-marra=b

child-ERG 3-TR-swing-CONT spear walk-TEMP=REL

i-n-nya-n.

3-TR-catch-CONT

‘The child is walking along swinging the spear.’ (BOW-FN.12/34)

It appears as though the semblative marker has taken over the functions of the temporal marker -karr(a), which is reconstructible to Proto-Nyulnyulan but which does not exist in Bardi apart from a few instances in frozen words such as ginyinggarra ‘then’.
Just as the semblative can be used to mark ﬁnite temporal clauses, the allative can be used to mark purpose clauses. All examples available to me have the verb of the dependent clause in the future tense. (16.104) provides representative examples.

682 Clause Combining

(16.104)

a. Anggaba ngankangarrga goolboongan oonkoomoolbangay, biilamb nganka anyjimadan.

Anggaba nga-n-k-angarrg-a goolboo-ngan who 1-TR-FUT-ask-FUT money-ALL

oo-n-koo-moolb-a=ngay, biil=amb

3-TR-FUT-lend-FUT=1M.DO again=THUS

nga-n-k-a

anyjimadan.

1-TR-FUT-(give)-FUT return.

‘Whom can I ask to lend me money? I will give it back.’

b. Anjangarrga videotapengan oonkoomoolbangay! A-n-jangarrg-a videotape-ngan 2.IMP-TR-ask-FUT video.tape-ALL oo-n-koo-moolb-a=ngay! 3-TR-FUT-lend-FUT=1M.DO

‘Ask him if he will lend me the videotape!’

In summary, case marking as a means of signaling subordination is more restricted than it is in other Nyulnyulan languages. Other subordination strategies are used instead. These include clause chaining and subordinating complementizers, serialization, and gerunds.

Appendix B Preﬁx Tables
The following tables give the underlying and surface forms for all tenses and numbers of Bardi verbs. Third person minimal and augment are given; other persons can be derived by substituting the appropriate person marker. A representative verb is given for each stem class. Thus all monovalent roots beginning with j inﬂect the same way as -jarrala- ‘run’. Sonorant-initial roots inﬂect the same way as -marra- ‘cook’ (that is, they trigger epenthesis in the same places). Where possible I used ambitransitive roots, to keep the forms as constant as possible. In the tables, the preﬁx chunks are separated from the root by a hyphen. The roots used are:
Intransitive/monovalent -banyi- ﬁnish -jarrala- run -gama- laugh -marra- cook Transitive/bivalent -banyi- kill -jala- see -gama- mock -marra- cook

Appendix D Information on Speakers and Texts

The following table contains a list of the textual abbreviations from which examples in the main text are taken. In addition to the texts listed here, examples are taken from Gerhardt Laves’ text collection (MS. 2189 at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra). Asterisked texts appear in Appendix E. Some of the stories were given titles in Bardi by their authors; others were given English titles, and some were untitled. I have provided English titles in those cases. Unglossed Bardi words in titles are names. Some stories were told in several versions. Copies of all these materials are archived at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.

Appendix E Texts
Here are a few texts in Bardi and Jawi. The texts were chosen to illustrate different periods of the Bardi record and different dialects of the language. The texts also illustrate various subjects from traditional Bardi narratives. Three stories are included from the Laves materials. Text 130 is in Jawi (see §1.2.4). It shows the characteristic third person past augment preﬁx combination nyarr-. There are also a number of phonetic differences between the Laves materials and Modern Bardi, some of which are probably due to researcher transcription differences, while others are probably genuine differences in the language. Work on these differences is ongoing.
These texts were glossed in Toolbox (www.sil.org/computing/toolbox). The examples in the rest of the grammar were glossed manually, using text expansion macros. Vowel length has not been marked on words in the texts.
1. Laves
Gerhardt Laves spent approximately four months working with Bardi speakers in 1928–1929, on Sunday Island, Boolgin, and Lombadina (with the majority of the time spent on Sunday Island). Laves’ texts are preceded by a re´sume´, a summary of the story in English which Laves seems to have collected before getting the story in Bardi. I have worked through the Laves materials with several Bardi speakers in 2003 and 2008. Laves annotated his own texts. I have included some explanatory annotations in these texts, where the language recorded is very different from the modern language. Where there is a note of the form Laves text difference: X : Y [annotation], this signals a substantive amendment to the original text. The ﬁrst item is the correction, the second is the original form, and the annotation provides a comment on what speakers said about the original form and why it was changed. Spelling differences between Laves and the modern language are silently corrected (so that words can be easily looked up in the Bardi dictionary), but ﬁnal vowels are left as in the original.

704 Texts

1.1. Text 142: Goolamana

This story was told to Laves by Agoomoo (page reference: 14/3961-3 (text); 3964-66 (res)). The story concerns the Dreamtime ﬁgure Goolamana, who crossed over from Sunday Island to the mainland on the eastern shore of King Sound. There he met a man speaking a Worrorran language, and since they did not speak each other’s languages, they both turned to stone.

1.2. Text 75: Story about Mirrdiidi people
Laves did not make a note of who told this story to him. (The page reference in the Laves corpus is 11/3297.)
Bessie Ejai gave the following explanation of fairy creatures called variously Mirrdidi, Mirrdiidi, or Mirridid(i). Mirrididi were fairy kids who lived all through the Dampier Peninsula and the Buccaneer Archipelago. When a stranger came to a new place, the Mirrididi would come up to him at night asking for their dad. Sometimes they would come in the shape of a kangaroo. If someone killed a Mirridid kangaroo during the day, at night in the camp the kangaroo would change back to a Mirridid person and say ‘now I’ll call you dad, because you speared me.’ They mostly came to men, but they could come to women too. They are a little like raya spirits, except raya can still be felt and seen on the islands, but the Mirrididi have all gone now. They are also a little like ingarda, the spirits who gave ilma to men. They used to make giidoonoo, or little houses.
Laves provided the following summary of the text: Mirrdiidi [mirridid] were little people from a long time ago. They fought people. They made a little house (giidoonoo). Somebody fought them and

Laves 707

another man (a boordij ‘big’ fellow). The Mirrdiidi went inside their little house. At night time (iidanngoorroo) another man came up and made a ﬁre and burned up the Mirrdiidi in the giidoonoo. The Mirrdiidi could not get out before dying. The big man ran away and nobody caught him. This is the end of the story in which the little fellow had been so pugnacious.

1.3. Text 130: Jawi

This text is in the Jawi language variety, told to Laves by Jamboo (page references are 14/3821-7 (text); 3827-31 (res)). Note that in this text there are a number of words which were not known. This is the story of a tidal wave that inundated Sunday Island. The timing of the wave is unknown, but given the proximity of the northwest Australian coast to Indonesia, stories of tidal waves are not surprising. The tidal waves resulting from the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 would have affected the area, and it is possible that this story refers to that event.
Laves’ summary (abridged): That dry (season) they were all together outside. This was a long time ago. The tide went out really far, so that the reef was uncovered, and the channel as far as the mainland. Then the water came up as far as the Sunday Island graveyard. Only that mountain Goorililiwa, that one rock, was above water. All the people went altogether to that one hill.

2.2. BDI1: How we know that Bardi people have always been here
This narrative was given by Jessie Sampi in 2001, in response to my questions about the Bardi origin legends reported in Dixon (1996). The sources of those legents are not given in that article and we have been unable to trace them; this is discussed further in §2.11.1 above. This text sets out the reasons why Bardi people should be considered the long-standing traditional owners of Bardi country.

2.4. AYI1: Fish traps (ayin)
Jessie Sampi told this story to Claire Bowern in 2001 as part of a series of vernacular deﬁnitions (that is, short texts in Bardi which deﬁne and describe a particular word). It’s a story about how Bardi people used to use ayin stone ﬁsh traps. Ayin are one of several types of traps used by Bardi people.

Further textual materials
There are four books of Bardi narratives available to Bardi people. For reasons of cultural sensitivity, Bardi speakers have asked that the unpublished materials not be made publicly available in their entirety at this stage. The ‘blue book’ (Bowern 2002) is a set of selected narratives recorded by Gedda

Modern stories 751
Aklif and Claire Bowern as part of a Bardi oral history project. Some of those texts were also put in a smaller book (Bowern 1999). Some of the texts recorded by C.D. (Toby) Metcalfe from Tudor Ejai and Johnny Boxer appeared in Hercus and Sutton (1986). Finally, a selection of narratives from Laves’ materials was typed, translated, and annotated in 2003.

Notes
Chapter 1
1. Others are Tangkic, in the Gulf Country and Mornington Island (on the other side of the country; see Evans 1995), and Bunaban, a small family comprising Bunuba and Gooniyandi, which adjoins the eastern end of Nyulnyulan (though spoken far from Bardi); see Harvey and Reid (1997).
2. The cases are (in Love’s orthography) a general locational case -nanje, an instrumental -njiniNge, an ablative -a. lp and an allative -Nuru.
3. Preverbs are also often called ‘coverbs’ in the literature on Australian complex predicates. See Schultze-Berndt (2000) and McConvell and Bowern (2011b) for examples; both terms are used in typology in other languages to refer to different constructions. See Chapter 13 for the definitions assumed in this work.
4. This is in contrast to some other hunter-gatherer groups, both within Australia and elsewhere, who do not have distinct names for their own or surrounding languages.
5. There was a subsequent epidemic on Sunday Island in 1919, where the mission records indicate 6 deaths between December 30th, 1919 and January 3rd, 1920, and many more in the adjacent months, out of a population of less than 100.
6. Nekes and Worms (1953:19) spell this name as Iwanjdjun (i.e. Iwanyjoon, which is the unlenited form), as though the stem were Iwany rather than Iwanyi; that is, it is probably from the Lombadina form of the word.
7. These observations are based on a conversation and elicitation with Nancy Isaac, September 2001. Speakers from One Arm Point talk about the language of Lombadina as being ‘heavy’ Bardi.

754 Notes
8. There are more Bardi/Jawi materials in Howard Coate’s collection, but I do not have permission from Coate’s executors to quote from them.
9. While McGregor and Stokes (2004) treat Nimanburru and Jabirr-Jabirr as dialects of Nyulnyul, Nimanburru has several features which indicate that it is a primary branch of Western Nyulnyulan. For example, it has no intervocalic lenition of stops (unlike Bardi) and it retains vowel length (unlike Nyulnyul). Almost nothing is known about Ngumbarl, but the small amount of material recorded by Peile and Bates suggests that it is an Eastern language. The name ‘Marangan’ is also used occasionally as another dialect belonging to the same group as Yawuru and Jukun. ‘Big’ and ‘Small’ are translations of the indigenous names of varieties of the Nyikina language.
10. I cannot identify this language at present. Schmidt (1919) says his data are from Mathew (1899). Mathew credits Joseph Bradshaw (Melbourne) as the supplier of language information from the Napier Range, Kimberley (i.e., Ruby Creek), and Sunday Island. The ‘Ruby Creek’ language is therefore probably either a Worrorran language or Bunuba.
11. The ﬁnal -m is the gender sufﬁx.
12. The designation of the subgroups as ‘Eastern’ and ‘Western’ follows Kimberley Aboriginal terminology rather than literal compass direction, since all the ‘Western’ languages are to the North of the ‘Eastern’ ones. The terminology is used because the ‘Western’ languages are associated with the sea cultures, while the ‘Eastern’ languages (Nyikina and Yawuru) have cultural ties to the interior desert cultures. Since the sea is to the west of the desert, Bardi and Nyulnyul have come to be known as ‘Westerners’. Note also that Nyulnyulan compass terminology is not directly equivalent to English. What it usually translated as ‘North’ is really much closer to ‘North-East’, since it is based on the direction of the prevailing winds; see §14.2.4.
13. For example, a Bardi speaker, on being presented with Stokes’s (1999) learner’s guide to Nyikina, could recognize individual words but could not translate full sentences.
14. I learnt from Bill McGregor in 2002 that Howard Coate burnt all his

Notes 755
Bardi materials at some point in the past, so that another linguist would not have access to the materials. A small amount of material survived and is housed at AIATSIS. I have had access to a tape made of Tygan (the father of Aubrey Tygan) speaking Jawi.
15. Portable housing, a term more evocative than its ofﬁcial name of ‘single men’s quarters.’
16. Other areas of the grammar where I have identiﬁed gaps in the corpus but was unable to conduct elicitation include secondary predication, multiple modiﬁers in the noun phrase, and NP sub-constituent ordering. The earlier sources contain a few morphemes (e.g. -jV; see §6.3.2) which have been unidentiﬁable in later materials. I list them here for completeness. There are also topics (for example, the semantics of quantiﬁers) where it was not possible to get all the information I would have liked in the ﬁeldwork time available.
17. I have avoided wherever possible basing frequency judgments on my impressions, since I am not a native speaker of the language and since my impressions are biased by extensive work with written sources; however, there were occasions where, in the absence of a tagged corpus, it was impossible to get accurate counts.
18. The Laves texts contain very little; I presume this is because of the way they were dictated.
Chapter 2
19. A survey was conducted for Native Title purposes but despite the conclusion of the case, its results remain inaccessible to researchers.
20. I point this out because of occasional claims in the literature that huntergatherer peoples do not always recognize young and mature members of the same species as the same animal. This may be true for some groups but it is certainly not true for Bardi people.
21. This word is frequently glossed in Aboriginal English as ‘tucker’ and I follow this convention here.

756 Notes
22. They were, however, eaten by Worrorran-speaking people to the North. Nancy Isaac (pers. comm., 2001) described the ﬁrst time she saw cycad nuts being prepared, when she was a little girl and stayed at the Kunmunya Mission in Ngarinyin territory.
23. Both of these types of poison are given in Aklif (1999) as Tephrosia crocea, but this is incorrect.
24. I do not have information on what the hooks were made of, but I assume they were bone or shell, as is common elsewhere.
25. Note that this view of camping and movement between sites implies that there would have been people in campsites who would not have belonged to the area. I have little information about residence patterns, since by the time I began work in this area, Bardi people had been living in missions or communities for several generations.
26. Metcalfe (1975a) has a note that this is a Jawi word. It is in fact a loan from a Worrorran language. Bessie Ejai said in 2011, however, that ngabaliny was the Jawi word and yarnkal was the Bardi word.
27. This large boomerang has arms of unequal length and resembles the number 7, hence its name.
28. Bardi underwent a sound change in which initial y and w were lost; compare Nyulnyul yangk ‘what’ with Bardi anggi, and Nyulnyul wul with Bardi o˙ola (Nyulnyul loses ﬁnal vowels and does not have contrastive vowel length). Thus the small number of words in Bardi which begin with these consonants can be identiﬁed as loans.
29. This word is homophonous with the word for boughshed, a type of shelter.
30. Note that this word is widespread in the Kimberley and is probably a loan into Bardi, since *riiji would have given riiyi by sound change.
31. In Yawuru and the other Western Nyulnyulan languages (which use section systems), jarndoo has shifted in meaning to ‘woman’.
32. Abbreviations used in Table 2.4 are the standard ones used in kinship

Notes 757
descriptions and for the most part can be inferred from the plain English designations; B, brother; C, child; D, daughter; e, elder; F, father; H, husband; M, mother; y, younger; Z, sister. Terms can be combined; thus MM is ‘mother’s mother’, FZC is ‘father’s sister’s child’, etc.
33. I have no information on whether the range of these and other kinship terms varies dialectally.
34. Note that because of the way that generations are ﬁgured, this does not necessarily mean that the women was much younger than the man, although that was frequently the case. There are situations where someone could be in the same generation as a grandchild but not very different in age. In large families where women begin having children early, the ﬁrst child of the oldest daughter might not be very different in age from the youngest child of her mother.
35. The fact that there is a category of ningalmoo implies that women had some power in land tenure. There is some doubt about the precise meaning of ningalmoo, however. Bessie Ejai suggested that the term referred speciﬁcally to the woman’s right to be on her husband’s country, because of the fact that she was married to him. However, the older sources (such as Metcalfe (1975a) are fairly clear that the word used to mean the rights accorded to a person through the matrilineal line.
36. This summary is reproduced in part from Bowern (2009) with some corrections.
37. Laura Kling (pers. comm.) tells me that in 2010 when she was working with Bardi speakers, many unidentiﬁed words were said to come from Jawi.
38. A further indication of this is the Laves story 120 where a Bardi man and a Worrorra man are standing on opposite sides of a cliff; they do not understand each other’s languages and because of this they are turned to stone. The text is given in full in Appendix E.
39. The only story I have recorded that may be related to the one reported by Dixon is that of Looman, a mythical island/place to the north-west or west of Bardi country where the spirits of people go when they die;

758 Notes
Dixon may have interpreted this as being a reference to an origin myth. I would not analyze the myth in this way. Note that the area to the northwest of Bardi country is the only area that is unknown, since the northern and northeastern seas were explored (and abutted Worrorran territory), and land extends in other directions. The area to the northwest is thus the only region which is not either well explored or inhabited by known groups. There is no reason to tie the Looman story to an origin myth.
40. The Lacepedes are two small islands (little larger than rocks) off the coast of the Dampier Peninsula to the West of Beagle Bay Mission.
Chapter 3
41. A brief description of Bardi phonetics is given in Bowern, McDonough, and Kelliher (in press). There is an earlier sketch in Metcalfe (1971) (which was the basis for the Bardi entry in the UPSID phonological database (Maddieson 1984)) but my analysis departs from Metcalfe’s in several ways.
42. The researchers agree in terms of the phoneme inventory of the language, although we do not all transcribe all words the same way. In general, Metcalfe under-differentiates vowel length. I overtranscribed retroﬂection in my early ﬁeld notes, though I later discovered that some of this might have been because of variation among speakers.
43. I do not give absolute counts here because there is some regularization in the transcription which means that the counts might not be quite accurate; however, the general impression of relative frequency holds.
44. There is good evidence for a sound change in Bardi where derived rrj sequences were lost. For example, the second person minimal topic marked direct object forms (discussed in §10.3.2 below) are all of the form =jarr+the direct object pronoun (cf. jarrngay ‘1MIN.DO’), except for the second person minimal form, which is =jirri. This would show the same historical formation as the other topic-marked DO forms if it were from *=jarrji with vowel harmony and loss of the stop following the trill. For harmony, see §3.7 below.

Notes 759
45. According to McGregor (1996b), Nekes and Worms (1953) claim that both e and o are phonemes, but Nekes and Worms (1953:49-50) state that o and u and e and i are in free variation, and they used e and o because it was what they heard, although if their sources used u and i they kept that spelling (e.g. Capell’s wordlists, which were one of Nekes and Worms’ sources).
46. Both ﬁnal and non-ﬁnal second syllables were included, although ﬁnal vowels, if articulated at all, tend to be longer than unstressed wordinternal vowels and include a substantial unvoiced component.
47. Then, as now, the School program is just about the only organization writing Bardi, except for linguists.
48. It is probable that the number of clusters with the glides y and w as the ﬁrst member has been underestimated. Previous authors on Bardi (including this author in early work) assumed that glides were not permissible in coda positions, and words in the dictionary with which potentially had glide clusters were syllabiﬁed as either Vyi or Vwoo. It has now become clear that such sequences actually contrast with VyC and VwC. This is currently being corrected in the dictionary.
49. Following Clements (1990), Clendon (1988), and others I take the sonority scale not as a primitive but as derived from phonological properties of segments and their organization in syllables.
50. The form ilngama is also recorded in Metcalfe (1975a).
51. I assume that the ﬁsh is so named because of the pebbly appearance of its head.
52. This is an area where an unwarranted assumption of homogeneity among Australian languages has probably led to an incorrect overgeneralization of a particular analysis. It is a great pity that in a desire to emphasize similarities among phonological inventories, Australianists have overlooked differences in phonotactics and allophonic realization.
53. I say ‘appears’ because my data set does not yet allow the requisite individual speaker analysis to determine to what extent the variation in patterns described here is the result of intra-speaker variation or whether

760 Notes
there is consistency at the speaker level. This is the subject of ongoing research.
54. I assume that the ablative case marker -go is underlyingly -go and not -gaboo, though this is what it comes from etymologically. If the sufﬁx were underlyingly -gaboo, then it would be disyllabic and a word like *kulinkapu would presumably be stressed /"kulin­kapu/; however, it seems to me to be extremely implausible that the ablative is anything other than -go ∼ -o in Modern Bardi.
55. The root was historically *wa or *wu, but sound changes in Bardi have eroded this so that this verb exhibits only the preﬁxes and sufﬁxes, and no root material.
56. The syllable ngay in the line is either the ﬁrst person minimal pronoun, or a ﬁller syllable. The ‘tree-cofﬁn’ is a metaphor for the canoe which the protagonist is paddling. Bardi ilma poetry often involves a series of images expressed by a few words, in some ways rather like haiku.
57. Mark Harvey (pers. comm.) has suggested that the lenition of g to y in preﬁxes might be best thought of as a morphologization of a change, since in Australian languages the usual outcome of velar stop lenition is w. I take this as an open question; for example, if the real sound change is deletion of the stop rather than lenition to a glide, but stressed vowels do not coalesce, then we might expect automatic glide insertion, the quality of which could be triggered by the surrounding vowels.
58. It also possibly applies to the interrogative clitic =gard(a), but that is difﬁcult to conﬁrm. It is possible that all examples of =arda in the corpus come from =barda rather than a mixture of =barda and =garda. Uncontroversial examples of the interrogative clitic =garda only surfaced in the 2008 ﬁeld trip.
59. Some speakers of Bardi denasalize equivalent clusters in English too; Nancy Isaac, for example, has been recorded as saying [sIk] for ‘sink’, and [kOlIwUt] for ‘Collingwood (football team)’.
60. We could reconstruct *la- for the intransitive irrealis forms, which would make the obstruent of the root intervocalic (cf. *u-la-gama ‘he might

Notes 761
laugh’); this would regularly result in oolama in Bardi. This contradicts the forms in Warrwa (McGregor 1994b), however, which point to a reconstruction *l- rather than *la-.
61. The phonological behavior of the sufﬁx -injoon may be an indication that it is a clitic or compounded element rather than a true sufﬁx. If it is a compounded element, it has no meaning as a separate word (it is homophonous with the third person minimal past inﬂected form of the verb -joo- ‘it did, it became’, but that is clearly unrelated).
62. I assume that the formation of vowel height harmony is the historical result of the treatment of sequences of *agu and *abu, both of which become o. Thus roots which ended in a received the o-variant of the sufﬁx. I assume that this has been extended to consonant-ﬁnal stems which have a as the vowel closest to the sufﬁx. Harmony is now, however, a synchronic process which applies to all applicable low vowels in the word (cf. (3.67a) above).
63. The unreduplicated form only appears with the inalienable possessive preﬁx, as in nalma ‘head, his head’.
64. ‘Inﬁxal’ reduplication of a similar pattern to that described for Bardi is found in a number of Northern Australian (non-Pama-Nyungan) languages, and has been most copiously described in Mangarayi (Merlan 1989). The Bardi pattern is clearly recent and the result of the morphologization of a regular sound change which is reﬂected in other areas of the language.
65. Such a change is implied by gamarda ‘maternal grandmother, MM’, which in the Eastern Nyulnyulan languages is gamirda. This word is a loan from a Pama-Nyungan language, however, and it is not certain at what time the loan entered the family.
66. Long vowels are shortened in reduplicants.
67. I note, however, that some Bardi speakers appear to place an [h] on vowel-initial words in English, even when dropping [h] otherwise; thus for some people, the word ‘hold’ is pronounced [old], but ‘old’ is pronounced [hold].

762 Notes
Chapter 4
68. Note that the distinction between uninﬂecting and inﬂecting word classes would not apply in this manner in most other Nyulnyulan languages, such as Yawuru and Nyulnyul, where preverbs can take inﬂectional marking. Note that in Bardi also, preverbs may serve as hosts for clauselevel clitics, though they take no regular inﬂectional marking.
69. Joe Blythe (pers. comm.) points out to me that name avoidance, while commonly reported for Australian languages, is seldom supported from analysis of conversational data, where personal names do appear. I do not have enough relevant data to test this for Bardi. In the Laves texts, personal names are used, though naming strategies based on the person’s patrilineal estate (booroo) are also frequent; see §2.9 for discussion.
70. In functional terms, one might also want to include here the various clausal clitics such as sentence connectives =min, =gid and =(j)amba and the completive particle (=)gala.
71. The third type of clitic, simple clitics, does not seem to exist in Bardi, though there may be some argument to be made that some of the verbal quantiﬁcational clitics described in §10.5 are bound in the modern language, but have the behavior of simple clitics in the earliest sources.
72. MacSwan (1998) discusses these criteria with respect to the polysynthetic language Southeast Puebla Nahuatl and concludes that several of these criteria are not, in fact, diagnostic of polysynthesis. I include all Baker’s criteria for completeness, however.
73. This cannot be the full story for the etymology of this word, however, because galbajoon does not show the lenition pattern expected in a such a case. We would expect the form galba-yoon in that case. It is possible either that the word is a loan from Nyulnyul or Nimanburru (neither of which shows intervocalic stop lenition), or that there could be another morpheme between the root and the denizen marker which has been deleted.

Chapter 5

Notes 763

74. Dryer (2011) calls this type of marking an ‘inpositional clitic’ and all seven of the languages given as examples are Australian. Further discussion is provided in §8.5.1 and §8.5.2.
75. Dench and Evans (1988) describe a fourth function, ‘associating case,’ which does not appear in Bardi.
76. I assume here that -goorroo in ‘doctorman’ is the Yawuru equivalent of the Bardi proprietive -goordoo and that this is a loan. Certainly jalnggoogoorroo is a widespread word throughout the Kimberley region.
77. Note that this use of irr is much more like a demonstrative than a simple number marker. Phrases with irr, for example, are always deﬁnite. Gornagijarr irr baawa cannot mean ‘children [in general] are good’.
78. This is a diagnostic for whether these are nouns or preverbs, though it is not a very good test since the sufﬁx is not very productive. It appears to be true that it only goes on nouns, but it cannot appear with all nouns.
79. This word was later accepted as a possible formation on my 2008 ﬁeld trip.
80. The -iidi sufﬁx is also recorded in Nyulnyul, Jabirr-Jabirr and Nimanburu, for example in djinbindjin-¯ed wamb (Nimb.) ‘a wise man’ (Nekes and Worms 1953:62), gelj lanybi-¯ed ‘the bowerbird is thieving’ (Nyulnyul, Jabirr-Jabirr) (Nekes and Worms 1953:82). Nekes and Worms (1953:83) records ¯ed (i.e. -iid in Karajarri as well, but the only example they give is bander-¯edi ‘strong’ (= Bardi bandoorriidi), which is probably a loan from a Nyulnyulan language. I have found no cognates for -iidi in other languages outside Western Nyulnyulan, although a sufﬁx with this function is very common. In Nyikina, for example, -dyinabur(u) ‘expert’ fulﬁls the functions that -iidi does, although -dyinabur(u) is not conﬁned to human referents. The Nyikina word for spectacles, for example, is nimilgarr-dyinabur (lit. ‘eyes-EXPERT’).
81. Although spontaneous examples were produced, I hesitate to conclude

764 Notes
that the sufﬁx is productive, given its rarity and the fact that speakers will also produce examples of the ‘expert’ -iidi spontaneously, and that is clearly not productive.
82. There is considerably variation in the transcription of retroﬂection across Nyulnyulan languages. Stokes (1982a) writes the comitative as containing an apical stop /t/ (written <d>), but the examples in Bardi have a retroﬂex stop.
83. A boongana is a boy who has been through law and has a hairbelt and pearlshell put on him; see further Aklif (1999). The ﬁrst verb in (5.30) is not identiﬁable; it appears to be the verb -golo- ‘wear’, but that does not ﬁt semantically. A better ﬁt would be ingarralanirr ‘they lived with them’; a and o appear rather similar in Laves’ handwriting.
84. While this is an ad-hoc proposed sound change, there are no other examples in the corpus of a ﬁnal ng on a stem which would be sufﬁxed by a form beginning with b. If we assume, as per §3.6.3, that coda velar nasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the follow stop, this would give *iinalambooloo, and nasal dissimilation (see §3.6.4) is attested in such environments.
85. I suspect that a few examples of items transcribed as =arr are actually mishearings of the third person augment direct object marker =irr, but I have been unable to conﬁrm this with speakers.
86. I follow Round (2009) in treating adnominal and relational case marking as a single type of inﬂection syntactically, though providing arguments for Bardi is beyond the scope of this grammar.
87. For transparency, and because the rule is an automatic phonetic one, I still write irrnim rather than idnim in texts. For another example see (5.51), which shows the same effect (although still written inkoorrnim, for [inkudnim]). Aklif (1994a) varies between writing idnim and irrdnim, which reﬂects casual versus careful speech. This is not a general rule of trills in contact with nasals, however, since forms like irrnga ‘their name’ are not pronounced [idNa].
88. This curlew was actually a ngaarri (a devil).

Notes 765
89. I would have expected the form of this sufﬁx to be -yi rather than -i, and -yi is found on a few words.
90. Other languages without ergative/instrumental syncretism include Yidiny (Dixon 1977), Guugu Yimidhirr (Haviland 1979), and Wathawurrung (Blake 1998).
91. Note the difference in allomorphy between -ng(a) and the ablative -(g)o, the other CV-shaped case marker (discussed in §5.4.5). They are not parallel; the instrumental has allomorphy with ﬁnal vowel loss, while the ablative has allomorphy with consonant loss.
92. (5.71) is an example where the verb is marked for the applicative (see §12.4, especially §12.4.2.4); as is quite common for applied instruments, however, the noun phrase which describes the instrument by which the action is carried out retains its case marking.
93. The complex predicate to express ‘to write’ is ‘paper-poke’.
94. This example was written down early in Laves’ ﬁeld trip. It is unknown what the afﬁx on ngo˙orra ‘camp’ is supposed to be. It is not similar to anything else in Bardi, and Laves glosses ngoorraji as ‘without ﬁre’, which is clearly incorrect. Ngo˙orra means ‘last night’ and ngoorriji means ‘tomorrow’, but neither of these words ﬁts the context. Nor does ngo˙orra normally mean ‘camp’ in Bardi, though such words are found in Pama-Nyungan languages to the south.
95. This implies that speakers have variable underlying forms for words which show this behavior.
96. The difference between -oon and -on is further clouded by the fact that /u/ in closed unstressed syllables is quite low, closer to IPA [o] than [u]. Therefore at this stage I cannot rule out the possibility that some of the exceptions are mistranscriptions, especially the ones that occur in narratives in fast speech. However, there are enough conﬁrmed exceptions that this is clearly a real phenomenon, and not ‘alternations’ which are simply due to transcription errors.
97. The phrase used for such motion is daab -nya-, literally ‘go ashore’; here it is better translatedas ‘go’.

766 Notes
98. I gloss ginyinggon simply as ‘then’, rather than as the etymologically correct 3MIN-LOC ‘at that, at it’, because the gloss ‘then’ better reﬂects the way the word is used.
99. Mooyoon ‘in the morning’ is clearly related to the word mooyoo ∼ mo˙oyoo, recorded in Metcalfe (1975a) as ‘daybreak, very early morning’ (I transcribed the vowel as short, but Metcalfe (1975a) has a long vowel). There is no uninﬂected root *mila, but there is an adverb milarra ‘about to happen, almost happened’, which looks like it is historically a root mila combined with the temporal marker -garra. The latter only appears fossilized in Bardi (see §5.1.11.1). Both milarra and milon provide some evidence for a stem *mila.
100. Note also that many of these place names have what appear to be exceptional locative forms without lenition.
101. This appears to be a regular historical change in Jawi for /N/ in non-initial and non-post-stress position. See §3.6.2 for more details.
102. I have not tested examples such as ‘there is a stick with a dog,’ but even if they are judged as unacceptable, it is impossible to rule out pragmatic reasons rather than grammatical ones.
103. The words that were exceptional in the locative and ablative in taking the consonantal allomorph of the case sufﬁx, despite ending in a vowel, are not exceptional in the source case. The noun gaarra ‘sea’, for example is regular in the form gaarrayoon.
104. Example (5.180) contains the word barnyjangarra; this was given by Laves as part of the phrase barnyjangarra irrgoordoo ‘that’s all’; irrgoordoo means ‘how’ and the ﬁrst word in the phrase contains the emphasis clitic =jangarra, but the root is not known.
105. While I have not tested this explicitly it would be very surprising, given the size of the corpus and the functions of compounding described here, if more than two items could be compounded.
106. The word booroo could also be regarded as a technical term which refers to the patrilineal estates which together make up Bardi country.

108. Such arguments are very difﬁcult to make, however, and speakers ﬁnd it difﬁcult to articulate the difference in meaning between the two orders. Moreover, my corpus is not big enough to provide many examples of the postnominal order, and since it is not tagged for part of speech, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd examples. This is a point for future research.
109. In fact, it is not true for about half of the Australian languages in a recent survey of numeral meanings; see Zentz and Bowern (2011) for further information.
Chapter 7
110. Another piece of evidence that the non-Pama-Nyungan Kimberley languages do not have have the more familiar singular/dual/plural system is the behavior of Nyikina ‘dual’ and ‘plural’ marking (Stokes 1982a). Nyikina has a sufﬁx, -mirri, which is added to the ‘augment/plural’ pronouns to mark something like a ‘dual’. For example, dyuwa is ‘you (singular)’ and gurrgamirri is ‘you two’. When -mirri is added to the ﬁrst person dual inclusive, however, the result is a trial pronoun (‘you and me and him’), not a dual. This is known as a unit augment system. This does not occur in Bardi, however.
111. This usage of the ignorative is also found in codeswitching by some of the oldest Bardi speakers, who say things like ‘who dat anggi?’ ‘who’s that person?’.
112. In (7.51a), Algooroo is a term of address used by men to call their brothers and male cross and parallel cousins.
113. Another common greeting is anggi jawal ‘what’s up?’ (lit. ‘what story?’ or ‘what news?’).
114. The verb form ngangganji is unidentiﬁable. It is a ﬁrst person future

768 Notes
form of an intransitive verb root, but the root is not otherwise recorded in the Laves collection or other sources.
Chapter 8
115. I composed several short stories in English (for example, there was one about a ‘big scary crocodile with sharp teeth’) and asked speakers to translate them. Speakers did not produce complex noun phrases in such stories, however, even when I drew attention to the pattern and asked for a direct translation.
116. There is some evidence that agal ‘and’ can conjoin both full NPs and N s. In the former case, both items in each NP receive a case marker. In the latter, there is a single case marker.
117. Laves was taking dictation without a recorder.
118. Since all the Bardi speakers I worked with on grammatical elicitation were careful to distinguish between cases where there was no difference in meaning to them, and when there was a difference that they weren’t able to articulate in English, I take this as evidence that—at least for the sentences I asked about—differences in order are stylistic rather than syntactic.
119. This ordering may well also explain a fact established by Gedda Aklif for adnominal case marking. Nouns marked with the comitative case -nyarr may precede or follow, but there is a strong preference for the modiﬁer preceding the noun in elicitation, especially when case-marked:
a. Jiidinyarr aamba inyjarralij. Jiidi-nyarr aamba i-ny-jarral-ij. beard-COMIT man 3-PST-run-PFV ‘The man with a beard ran.’
b. ?Aamba jiidi-nyarr i-ny-jarral-ij. c. [*aamba-nim jiidinyarr] i-n-am-boo-gal goorlil. d. Jidinyarr-nim aamba i-na-m-boo-gal goorlil.

(AKL:PE1-4)

120. Apart from three Nyulnyulan languages, the other languages described as having inpositional clitics are the Bunuban languages Gooniyandi (McGregor 1990) and Bunuba (Rumsey 2000), along with Anindilyakwa (Leeding 1989) and Kuuk Thaayorre (Hall 1972). Bardi is not included in Dryer’s sample. Bunuban case marking is different from Nyulnyulan, in that case may optionally appear on more than one item in the phrase. Moreover, the member of the phrase which takes the case marker is determined pragmatically rather than distributionally/structurally, as is the case in Nyulnyulan languages. See further McGregor (1989b).
121. One possible analysis would be that case features are only licensed by an element in the speciﬁer position of a DP.
122. Note that bornko ‘around’ is another example of a bleached case-marked word; speakers no longer connect it to baarnka ‘outside’.
123. Discussion with Jessie Sampi in 2011 implied that this is the case for some examples, but it is not know if this is a general result.

Chapter 9
124. In Bowern (2004b) there was an error where the reﬂexive/reciprocal sufﬁx and the ﬁrst applicative marker were reversed. It is corrected here.
125. This information is also summarized in the Bardi dictionary (Aklif 1999) and in Appendix B.
126. Many of these dependencies can be reconstructed to Proto-Nyulnyulan; see Bowern (2012) for more information.
127. Thus past tense and present tense are homophonous in the j-initial roots. This is also the case for some roots beginning with nasals (e.g. -nya‘catch’) and laterals. Only the b- and g- initial roots consistently make the distinction, although they are the most common roots, together ac-

770 Notes
counting for about a third of all roots in Aklif (1999). See §9.2 for a more detailed discussion.
128. Note: -jiidi- + applicative1 means ‘touch’ and forms a transitive stem. For discussion of applicatives, see §12.4, and for applicative1, §12.4.1.
129. The oblique clitics are also called ‘Indirect’ by, for example, Metcalfe (1975b) and Aklif (1993a).
130. I have not called this slot an ‘agreement’ slot per se because it does not function the way the other two true ‘agreement’ slots behave. That is, the possessor marking does not cross-reference an external argument in the clause. For example, it is not grammatical to say *Ngajana birrii Broomengan inyjiidinajan. ‘My mother went to Broome’, with both ngajana and =jan marking the ﬁrst person minimal possessor (without dislocation; the sentence is grammatical with the meaning ‘my mother, she went to Broome’). This is in contrast to the oblique clitics, which are true agreement clitics and surface even when another reference appears overtly in the clause.
131. I would expect second person agreement marking to be jiy. Alternatively it may be a form of the simultaneity sufﬁx, -j (§11.2.7), although in that case I would expect oonkalj or oonkalaj, not oonkalij.
132. I treat applicative marking as syntactic here, since its effects are on the transitivity of the predicate, but not the valency of the root.
133. I use Metcalfe’s orthography and glossing here; in the practical orthography the word would be written angarramananarr.
134. Note that Metcalfe (1975b) analyzes the root ‘give’ as -a-, whereas I follow Aklif (1999) in analyzing it as an empty morpheme -ø-.
135. The instrumental case -ng(a) is reconstructible to *-ngany, which has shifted in meaning from comitative to instrumental in the Western Nyulnyulan languages. Arranga preserves the old meaning. For discussion of arranga (and negation more generally), see §15.3.4.
136. To illustrate the template she gives as an example ingarrmarranan ‘they used to eat turtle’ (Nicolas 2000:158). Unfortunately for Nicolas, ingarr-

Notes 771
marranan does not mean this; it means ‘turtles used to cook’ (intransitive); it is the monovalent form of the verb. The Bardi corresponding to the English gloss is ingarramarranan. Also, ingarrmarranan does not contain a sequence -na ‘past’ + -n ‘continuative’ (illustrating Nicolas’ claimed morpheme order of Tense + Aspect); the underlying form is in fact -na-na ‘continuative-remote past’, with metrical vowel dropping (cf. ingarrmarranana with no change of meaning).
137. In some other Nyulnyulan languages, oblique and direct object clitics may not both appear simultaneously. This is the case in Nyikina (Stokes 1982a), for example. However, examples with both appearing together in Bardi are copious.
138. The loss of ny- in this root in Bardi is not regular, but not unexpected, given the frequent simpliﬁcation of NC clusters to C. It is regular, however, only in syllables with a tautosyllabic nasal.
139. This is somewhat problematic. Although DW in Text IWA:8 has the same reduplication for the same semantics, [no˙orroo] angoorroolooloorroo ‘we lit a big ﬁre’, Aklif has notes beside it: one ﬁre, boordiji no˙orroo angoorrooloorroo ‘[we lit a big ﬁre]’, then ‘several ﬁres : reduplication.’ Therefore it is possible that it is the clitic =nid that makes the difference in interpretation, not the reduplication speciﬁcally.
140. The term ‘light verb’ goes back to Jespersen (1954/1909), and is used to denote verbs which can regularly appear bleached of some or all of their semantic content.
141. It is possible that the root is not in fact irregular in terms of valency. If the form of the root is analyzed in the present as -rli- rather than -arli-, the sequence nrl (n + retroﬂex l) will regularly give rl. The root would still irregularly lose its initial vowel in the present.
Chapter 10
142. In another version of this story, at an equivalent point in the story the speaker uses more emphatic forms, such as the interjection arra ‘look!’

143. Recall from §12.2.2.3 that verb ‘give’ in Bardi takes the recipient as the direct object, and the theme is unmarked on the verb.
144. For the related principle of ‘empathy,’ which is probably also a factor in jarr marking, see Kuno 1987:203ff.
145. The Set II markers are probably related to the use of jarri as a subordinate clause marker in Warrwa:

Warrwa

Ngambalany-jarri bij nganandiny ngajanu naarda. 1st:awoke-SEQ open 1sg:got my eyes

‘When I woke up I opened my eyes.’

(McGregor 1994b:58)

146. While I abbreviate glossing for the oblique markers as IO (for ‘indirect object’), I call them ‘oblique’ because their function is broader than typical indirect object marking.
147. Injoonoojin also has a variant injoonajin, which does not show vowel harmony.
148. Note that this example also illustrates the fact that Bardi body parts may be inalienably possessed, and that Bardi does not show the otherwise quite common Australian pattern of using accusative pronouns with possessed body parts.
149. Note that Bardi also has pluractional marking proper, which is signaled by reduplication; see further §3.8.

Notes 773
150. There are a few other clitics and afﬁxes that appear both with and without their initial consonants, without a clear phonological conditioning environment. For example, the possessive clitics described in §10.4.3 above appear without their initial j when they are preceded by the oblique markers; there is no phonological reason for this, nor a reconstructible diachronic change to account for it. Likewise, the interrogative clitic =(b)arda shows presence or absence of the initial consonant, and the distribution is not clearly accounted for by synchronic lenition.
151. It is possible that this sentence is a calque from English, but it is unlikely, given the early date, when knowledge of English was probably not yet widespread on Sunday Island.
Chapter 11
152. Past tense verbs tend to have past tense sufﬁxes, but they may instead show the continuous aspect marker -n, as in my examples here, in which case the sole clue to the tense to the verb comes from the non-deletion of the transitivity marker.
153. The verb root -garnboo- is glossed as ‘growl’, an Aboriginal English term that means something like ‘vituperate’ or ‘scold’.
154. This type of bird is common in ilma song language but we have not been able to identify the species.
155. Ngay(oo) in song language is a ﬁller word, like ‘la’ in English singing, although sometimes (e.g. in (11.36a)) it is also used as the ﬁrst person minimal pronoun.
156. Aarlimayi is a compound of aarli ‘meat-food’ and mayi ‘vegetable food’.
157. The cognate of gala in the Eastern languages is galiya, with broadly the same functions as Bardi’s gala. Similar forms are also found in surrounding, non-Nyulnyulan languages (e.g. Walmajarri).
158. Further evidence that the epenthetic n- of gerunds of vowel-initial roots is neither a part of the stem nor the transitive marker comes from Nyi-

774 Notes
kina. Note that -ibi- ‘drink’ behaves differently in Nyikina from the ninitial roots like -nika- ‘follow’, so here we can tell that n is behaving epenthetically and not as part of the root.

Nyikina a. manibin ‘to drink, drinking’
but b. yarribi, not yadibi (by analogy with -nika- producing yadika). c. ngalibin, not ngallibin (again by analogy with -nika-).

159. The use of the source case -joon in such examples may relate to a similar use of an ‘intensiﬁer’ in Yawuru, which is found in examples such as the following (using Hosokawa’s gloss):

Yawuru I-luka-rn-dyunu 3-cry-IMPF-REALLY
‘He cries for himself.’

(Hosokawa 1991:113A)

160. In Chapter 16 we will see examples of subordinate clauses where a constituent from the subordinate clause is focused in initial position in the main clause. If gerunds are clauses rather than noun phrases, (11.66) would provide a parallel example. However, I do not have the data to show whether gerunds with arguments are noun phrases or non-ﬁnite subordinate clauses.

Chapter 12
161. The number of lexical entries for inﬂecting verbs in the current Bardi lexicon is 340. However, 25 are recorded only in Metcalfe or Laves and are not recognized by current speakers. Another 5 are Jawi only, and the 20 ambitransitive roots are listed twice, with monovalent and bivalent meanings separately. (This is because Aklif’s (1999) Bardi dictionary lists verbs by third person minimal past agreement preﬁx; thus

Notes 775
imbirrilin ‘it ﬂew’ and inambirrilin ‘he/she swung it’ occur separately.) 15 more verbs are listed separately with their reﬂexive/reciprocal circumﬁx. Therefore the total number of unique roots in Bardi is a little under 300.
162. The same three-way distinction in valency (monovalent, bivalent and ambitransitive) holds for other Nyulnyulan languages. Stokes (1982a), for example, divides Nyikina’s roots into Set I, Set II, and alternativepreﬁxing or ambitransitive. Hosokawa (1991) makes the same distinction. Hosokawa also has a fourth class. In Yawuru a small set of monovalent roots are marked in the future with the bivalent preﬁx wal- (related to Bardi’s a-), rather than the monovalent nga- (= Bardi nga-). I have not found this class in other Nyulnyulan languages. Although I refer to valency rather than transitivity in this chapter, I retain the term ‘ambitransitive’ to ensure consistency with other grammars of Nyulnyulan languages.
163. There are a few other complex predicates with preverbs which take inalienable marking, but they vary as to what the argument structure of the predicate is as a whole. Most of them are not impersonal.
164. The more usual verb ‘to die’ is -jimbi-.
165. A similar list of verbs can be made for Nyulnyul. McGregor (2002:230) lists the ambitransitive verbs found for Nyulnyul. There are some differences between the languages, however. Nyulnyul -bamarr- ‘shiver’, whose cognate -bamarra- is only monovalent in Bardi, also has a bivalent counterpart ‘make shiver’ in Nyulnyul only. There are a few more unergative ambitransitive verbs as well, including -wid- ‘eat’, which does not exist in Bardi.
166. Note that I am not arguing that one set of the ambitransitive verbs is derived from the other; I simply note the argument structure patterns between them.
167. This is not conclusive, however—the example is from the Bardi dictionary, and it is possible that the translation was given in Aboriginal English, where ‘himself’ is unmarked for number and so can be used in either reﬂexive or reciprocal meaning.

776 Notes
168. Stokes (1982a:291) gives the verb root as -barnji- rather than -banji-. I do not know if this is a transcription error of if the root has a retroﬂex nasal in Nyikina.
169. If examples such as (12.73) contain both a direct object and an applied (or second) object, they provide a counter-example to my claim that Bardi has no ditransitive constructions. That claim is true for underived verbs. However, the status of the applied object is unclear. For example, as seen in §10.3.1 above (and especially (10.14) on page 401), there are occasional ‘additional’ predicative clitics on the verb, which appear to signal topic status rather than providing agreement for an argument.
170. I have no data about whether example (12.78) can receive a reciprocal interpretation; that is, ‘We cover each other with sand.’ It is likely that such an interpretation is possible, since every augmented sentence I asked for had both reﬂexive and reciprocal interpretations.
171. I suspect the correct form is -nginj, and -nginyj is a transcription error. However, examples from both Aklif’s ﬁeld notes and my own show enough variant transcriptions to make this uncertain.
172. It is quite possible that the ergative-marked NP in such constructions is not a true argument, and that would explain why it is always present in these constructions. Arguments can be omitted if their reference can be recovered from context. The sentences in (12.89) are all grammatical without their ergative-marked NPs, but the meaning is different. Example (12.89a) would mean ‘I am sick.’
Chapter 13
173. Discussion of aspects of Bardi complex predicate constructions appeared in Bowern (2010b), which was based on the same chapter of Bowern (2004a) that forms the basis of this chapter.
174. I use the term ‘preverb’ in this work in line with previous writing on Bardi and Nyulnyulan languages. The other term which commonly occurs in the literature on northern Australian languages is ‘coverb’ (e.g. as in Wilson 1999). The terms are equivalent.

Notes 777
175. For example, Wilson (1999) and Clendon (2000) use nominalization tests to make generalizations about the syntactic behavior of preverbs in Wagiman and Worrorra respectively. Such tests are very difﬁcult to implement in Bardi, however, simply because nominalization is not an option for most preverbs, and for those that do seem to allow nominalization, the preverb almost always has cross-categorical membership in another word class.
176. Sentential negation forces irrealis marking on the inﬂecting verb. See further §15.3.1.
177. For our purposes here, it does not matter what theoretical position one takes on how arguments are realized within a clause (through speciﬁcation in lexical entries, for example, or through structural positions in a tree). The only crucial point is that the verbal head of the clause speciﬁes the number of arguments in the clause and their semantic roles. For further discussion, see Dowty (1989), Jackendoff (1987) amongst many others.
178. Inﬂecting roots can also be reduplicated to mark iterativity/durativity, although this is rather rare in complex predicates; one of the few examples is boor -jala- ‘stare’ with boor -jalala- ‘keep on staring’.
179. In example (12.3.2) the verb root has been deleted through regular morphophonological processes. The underlying form is -m-joo-inyji(REFL1-‘say’-REFL2).
180. Unfortunately, I do not have data from negative verbs which would be diagnostic here.
181. About half the languages of Northern Australia that have complex predicates allow preverbs to appear without light verbs in some functions. See McConvell and Bowern (2011a) and Bowern (in prep.a) for data.
182. These data were collected in 2003 from a speaker who was otherwise quite comfortable forming applicatives.
183. The cognate -kaj is also found sporadically.
184. Recall from §13.2.4 above, and especially (13.8b), that some adjectives

778 Notes

may undergo reduplication when they are functioning as preverbs, but not otherwise.

185. This is the precise cognate of the same construction in Warrwa, where
the form of the preverb is liyan-ngany (the cognate of the instrumental
in Bardi) and the same light verb -ma- ‘put’ is used: Warrwa:

Ngayi-na marlu liyan-ngany ngalama manyjayinu. 1MIN-ERG NEG like-INS 1M-IRR-put many.

‘I don’t like them all.’

(McGregor 2008a:29)

186. The term is due to Massam (2001). The term refers to an analysis of Niuean verbal predicates containing an object, which shows many of the properties of an incorporated noun, but nonetheless remains an independent phonological word.

187. As in many Australian languages, in Bardi generic nouns are often used with more speciﬁc nouns in a type of noun classiﬁer construction. For further details see Wilkins (2000) and §5.6.

188. Material from this section is presented in Bowern (2008b) along with an analysis using LFG.

189. A reader suggests that this discussion is overly theory-internal for a reference grammar. I disagree. Since deﬁning the limits on how verbs combine with arguments is an important part of determining the grammaticality of predicates (in any language), it is important to consider the implications of the logic applied to simple verbs when it is applied to complex predicates.

190. The only exception is the root -gal(a)-, which is ambitransitive but always takes the n- ∼ a- transitivity morpheme.

191. ‘Le verbe complexe est compose´ de la meˆme base verbale accompagne´e d’un pre´verbe.’ The complex verb is composed of the same verbal bases, accompanied by a preverb. (Nicolas 1998:73).

192. This is not the case in earlier stages of the language; the Laves corpus has instances of -ganyi- without a preverb and Metcalfe (1975a) lists -ganyi-

Notes 779
alone in the meaning ‘climb’. In my elicitation, however, speakers say that the use of this verb without a preverb is ungrammatical.
193. Despite appearances, this word does not appear to be a loan from English.
194. The verb can only be used for actions such as beating or clubbing with an instrument, not ones where the instrument is thrown and leaves the hand. The verb -ngooloo- ‘throw’ is used is that case. The verb -boousually means ‘hit with hand’, but it also has other senses, including ‘spear’ and ‘kill’.
195. One uses a lousing stick, which has the approximate dimensions of a pencil, to pierce the lice and remove them.
Chapter 14
196. I assume that the ablative of ‘east’ and ‘west’ are possible, but since I do not have examples of them, I do not include them here. They should be baanarrgo and goolorrgo respectively.
197. The word for yesterday, bardi, has a short vowel. The language name has a long vowel, but is written here as Bardi rather than Baardi because the spelling with a single vowel is established in the literature.
198. Joodinyko is an adverb which is found both with and without the ablative case.
199. The only other form that shows this, to my knowledge, is -injoon, and that only occasionally. See §5.1.7 above.
Chapter 15
200. I have included here both forms which are monoclausal but contain more than one verb, and clauses which contained discontinuous constituents. In the order VOV, the O is the object of both verbs; I had no basis for choosing between coding of such clauses as V, OV or VO, V. I have listed here all such occurring sequences.

780 Notes
201. Readers unfamiliar with these terms should see Carnie (2002:Ch. 4) for more detailed explanation than is provided here.
202. The form bilijina is difﬁcult to parse. It is most likely the word biila ‘again’ (which Laves spells bili) combined with a cliticized form of the third person minimal possessive pronoun =jina. However, the form is not found elsewhere in recorded Bardi materials and the repetition of jina is unexpected. Speakers did not recognize it.
203. A baali ‘boughshed’ is a temporary shade structure or shelter made by covering upright sticks with palm fronds.
204. Aklif would have worked through the text when transcribing with another Bardi speaker—most probably Jessie Sampi or Nancy Isaac. Aklif’s transcript are usually very close to the speech of the original narrative, but they occasionally differ in small details, such as the clausal discourse particles used; English words are also usually replaced with Bardi equivalents.
205. I use the term following McGregor (2008b).
206. I owe this observation to work by Laura Kling in 2010.
207. Unfortunately, all these examples were elicited in isolation, so I have no data on how such questions are answered.
208. I do not have extensive data on this construction. The following examples were discussed with Nancy Isaac in 2001 (Bk3, p.17).
Chapter 16
209. Some discussion of this topic appeared in Bowern (2008c).
210. I retain Hale’s terminology here, but as will be clear from the following discussion, adjoined relative clauses are not strictly a type of relative clause.
211. I should emphasize here that I do not think this is because such differences are syntactically fuzzy; rather, it is because most of the tests which

Notes 781
would clarify the difference rely on nuanced syntactic judgments which are difﬁcult to elicit.
212. The alternation in vowel length is unexpected in this form.
213. An example is garra garra garra, which is a type of elliptical for stuff that happens in a narrative. e.g. <X did something>, garra garra garra (X kept on doing it, e.g. they kept on walking), <then they did something else>.
214. In the textual counts discussed in Table 15.1, approximately 10% of the clauses could not be clearly divided and so VSV and VOV orders were included ‘as is.’ There was no discernable intonation boundary and no other evidence for clause boundaries, such as clitic placement.
215. It probably appears fossilized in anggaba ‘who’. Only Bardi has a distinction between ‘who’ and ‘what’; other Nyulnyulan languages have a cognate of Bardi anggi ‘what’ in both meanings.
216. This is the case in Diyari (Austin 1981), for example; see Nordlinger (2006b) for a survey of Australia more generally.
217. Many of Nordlinger’s (2006b) examples of Wambaya center-embedding are single non-ﬁnite verbs. In this case, it is difﬁcult to tell whether such items are really embedded clauses, or whether they are in fact nominals. (This is an issue for further study, not a claim that Nordlinger is incorrect.)
218. Relative clause markers are commonly used in forming place name phrases in the adjacent Worrorran languages (Clendon 2000, Rumsey 1982). Bardi place names do not have this structure, however.
219. Example (16.98b) comes from a typescript of C. D. Metcalfe. I have no explanation for the form =boo rather than =ba; I assume that it is a typographical error (Metcalfe writes <u> rather than <oo>). The typescripts are mostly quite clear, but they do contain the occasional error.
