ACKNOWLEDGMENTS “For the LORD gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding.”
Proverbs 2:6 (Lockman 1977) I would like to acknowledge and express my appreciation to my wife, Susan R. Quigley for her assistance in collecting data for this paper and for her many comments and suggestions in the presentation of the data. Most of the background research presented in the Introduction is the result of us co-laboring together in the Awara area since 1994. Since she has co-authored several of the papers referenced in that section, the pronouns ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’ in those sections refers to the two of us. I also wish to express my appreciation to all our Awara friends at Tawaya village who gave of their time and energy in assisting us in many practical ways. Also to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Kurang Parish (formerly Awara Parish), for formally inviting us to work with them. I also wish to express appreciation to all our friends, families and churches who have supported us financially. It was through their generosity that we have been able to pursue this project. I also wish to express my appreciation to SIL International, Papua New Guinea Branch, for their assistance and encouragement in completing this thesis. Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to my committee members, John M. Clifton, J. Albert Bickford, and Mark E. Karan for their valuable comments and suggestions in making this a better thesis.

ABSTRACT Awara is a Papuan language of Papua New Guinea spoken in the Finisterre Mountain Range. Though it has been mentioned in papers written about the FinisterreHuon languages and about the Wantoat language (another language in the Wantoat family), the Awara sound system has not been described in depth. This paper describes the Awara phonemic inventory, autosegmental features, morphophonemic processes, and implications for the Awara orthography. The analysis is presented within the framework of rules-based Generative Phonology. Interesting aspects of the language shown here are 1) prenasalized voiced stops, 2) complex phonemes /kw/, /˜w/ and /gw/, 3) non-universal morphophonemic processes such as devoicing of consonants intervocalically and voicing of consonants after voiceless stop consonants, and 4) counterfeeding and counterbleeding relationships between various morphophonemic processes.

separating them from the Wantoat region.3 The steep mountainous terrain is mostly tropical rain forest with large sections of elephant grass on the western slopes. Weather conditions are moderate with morning sunshine and afternoon and evening showers. Daytime temperatures are from 78 to 82°F and nighttime temperatures are from 55 to 65°F.
The cultural mindset of the Awara people focuses on group harmony and group consensus. Conflicts are resolved at the village level by meeting together to discuss the problem and agreeing on a mutually acceptable solution. Often, such discussions take place after evening devotions or after the Sunday morning church service.
Though there are separate church and local government positions, there is little separation of church and government at the local level. All local government functions (meetings, community work projects, etc) are organized at the community church gatherings. Regional government issues are usually discussed at the regional church meetings as well. The local government community leaders often hold leadership positions in the local church (Quigley and Quigley 1999a).
2 Awara people's perception of a village generally contains 10 or more houses and usually has a church building present. A hamlet contains less than 10 houses (usually 25) and is inhabited by 1 to 3 families. People living in hamlets usually identify themselves with the closest main village and/or the local church present in the main village. 3 Kongaim Mission and Wantoat plus the villages of Yapalengang, Arawek, and Matap, as labeled in Figure 2, are all part of the Wantoat region.

1.2 Language and Dialect Awara is a Papuan language of the Trans-New Guinea phylum, Finisterre-Huon
Stock, Wantoat Family (Wurm and Hattori 1981:8). It is one of six languages in the Wantoat Family, the locations of which are shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Language Map4 There have been differences of opinion concerning whether Awara is a related
language or dialect5 of Wantoat as well as what constitutes the Awara language. McElhanon and Claasen (1970) classified the northern and central Awara villages as one 4 This map was based on the Wurm, Hattori map 8 (1981) with modifications based on language surveys in the surrounding language groups (Quigley and Quigley 1999b) 5 See Loving (1977) for more information and standards followed in SIL-PNG.

Figure 4. Awara Classification Map

The southern Awara villages were classified as a separate language called Leron which

was related to Wantoat with an apparent cognate count of 70%. Hooley and McElhanon 5

(1970) classified all of Awara as a single language related to Wantoat with an apparent cognate count of 65%. However, Davis (1969) classified Awara as a single dialect of Wantoat.
The differences between the analyses most likely lie in the sampling of data (that is, which villages in the language group were surveyed). The entire Wantoat language family, including Awara, is part of a major language chain spanning most of the Huon Peninsula to the east and extending west into the Finisterre Range in Madang Province. The Wantoat villages closer to the Awara border are more similar to Awara than those on the far side of the Wantoat language border. This is also true of the Awara villages. Tawaya and Yapuläk have a shared apparent cognate count closer to 70% with the Wantoat village Yapalengang while the villages on the west side of the Leron River are closer to 60%. Overall, Wantoat and Awara are related with a shared apparent cognate count of 63% (Quigley and Quigley 1999a).
Awara first appeared in the Ethnologue as a dialect of Wantoat with the 3 letter designator [WNT] (Grimes 1992). However, starting with the 13th edition of Ethnologue, Awara is now classified as a separate language from Wantoat with the 3 letter designator [AWX] (Grimes 1996). Related languages in the Wantoat family that border Awara are Wantoat to the east and Wapu-Hiwan to the southeast. Gusap-Mot to the west and Adzera to the southwest are outside of the Wantoat language family (see Figure 3).
6

Other languages in the Wantoat family are Wantoat, Irumu, Yagawak, Bam, and Leron6 (Wurm 1977). However, application of the Cluster Analysis Average Link Method (E. Quigley 1995) to McElhanon and Claasen’s (1970) cognate chart data, indicates that Irumu and Yagawak should not be in the Wantoat language family but in the Erap language family located to the east. This reflects our own independent research regarding the Wantoat family (Quigley and Quigley 1999). It is unclear why they were included in the Wantoat language family.
As noted in Figure 5, we have grouped Awara into three dialects which are artificially named Southern, Central, and Northern Awara with the Central and Northern dialects forming a tighter group (Quigley and Quigley 1999a). The main differences between the Central and Northern dialects are lexical in nature. However, there are lexical, phonological, and morphological differences between the Southern dialect and the rest of the language group.
People view Awara and Wantoat as one language in relationship to other PNG languages. However, in discussing the related languages in the Wantoat family, they view Awara as a separate language from Wantoat. When discussing strictly Awara, they view the northern villages as speaking one variant of Awara, the central villages as speaking a second, and the southern villages as speaking a third. Finally, as we discussed variations within these regions, people viewed their language as based on which village they are from. They can tell which village individuals are from by the way they speak.
6 Leron mentioned here by Wurm (1977) is the southern dialect of Awara. Our own research (Quigley and Quigley 1999) has shown that those languages that make up the Wantoat language family are Wantoat, Bam to the east, Awara to the west, and WapuHiwan to the south.

1.3 Methodology
All fieldwork for this report was performed by myself and my wife Susan
Quigley, under the auspices of SIL International, Papua New Guinea Branch (SIL-
PNG). Data was gathered by means of informal and formal interviews (e.g. eliciting
wordlists and attitudes about the language). Fieldwork began in May 1994 after the
Evangelical Lutheran Church, Awara Parish, sent a formal invitation requesting SIL-
PNG to begin language development work for them. After completing a sociolinguistic
survey of the language group (Quigley and Quigley 1994) we moved to the hamlet of
Guninggwan (see Figure 2) in July 1994. The data for this report was based on the data
we collected at Guninggwan up to April 2003. Guninggwan is a small hamlet with an aid post8 and three households centrally
located in the language group. People from Tawaya, Yapuläk, Bakundupi, and Kanayik
come regularly to the aid post for medicine. Most of our daily contact was with Tawaya
people (a 10 minute walk away) and some with Yapuläk people (a 45 minute walk down
the mountain). We had periodic (weekly to monthly) contact with people from most other Awara villages traveling to the Wantoat Government Station9 (labeled as Wantoat
on Figure 2).
8 Aid post is the common term used in PNG for a small village clinic. It is staffed by an Aid Post Orderly (APO) who has received basic medical training somewhat equivalent to a paramedic. The main duty of the APO is first aid care (treating cuts and sores, broken bones, etc) and treatment of illnesses with medications. They also have training in delivering babies. 9 The Wantoat Government Station is the service center in the greater Wantoat subdistrict. Awara people go there to sell coffee (cash crop) and buy store goods (food, clothes, machetes, spades, and other household goods). Wantoat also has road access to the main urban centers—Lae and Madang. No road access exists in the Awara area.
9

The corpus of data for this thesis comes from texts recorded by eight men

varying in age from 25-50 from Tawaya and Yapuläk from 1994-1998. The texts

included narrative, expository, procedural, and hortatory types. Specific wordlists,

paradigms, and recordings of these paradigms were collected mostly from Yakating

Bana (age 30, male) and Silas Wango (age 45). Dialectal data from each Awara village

was collected over the span of time from 1994 to 1999 (Quigley and Quigley 1999a).

All Awara data has been archived at SIL-PNG in paper and electronic form per

contractual agreements with the government of Papua New Guinea.

1.4 Related Language Work.

There has been extensive work done by SIL-PNG in the related languages of the

Finisterre-Huon Stock including published and unpublished manuscripts on file at the

SIL-PNG Linguistic Library at Ukarumpa, EHP, Papua New Guinea. The following

tables list the more relevant works relating to Awara phonology and morphophonemics.

S. Quigley (2002b) contains some preliminary morphophonemic descriptions.

These were included to assist the reader in understanding the alternate surface forms as

presented in the data and to assign a preliminary underlying form (UF) for the sake of

discussing morphology and syntax. Also, S. Quigley (1997) contained a preliminary

phonemic inventory of the Awara language for the purpose of developing a preliminary

orthography. This paper takes a fresh and detailed look at the Awara sound system for

the purpose of justifying both the phonemic inventory and the morphophonemic

processes. Morpheme glosses, abbreviations, and definitions used in this thesis follow

those used in S. Quigley (2002a) and S. Quigley (2002b).

PHONEMIC INVENTORY

The phonetic transcriptions in the following examples follow a broad phonetic

transcription following the American tradition. In particular, the Chomsky/Halle vowel

system as defined in Pullum and Ladusaw (1986) was used in the transcription of the

central unrounded mid and low vowels and the mid rounded back vowel.

Table 4 lists those symbols that are used in this thesis that differ from the IPA

system.

Though this thesis does not focus on an acoustic analysis of Awara, there were

instances where acoustic analysis proved helpful. All acoustic analysis referred to in this

paper was done using PRAAT Version 4.0.X (Boersma 2002) on Macintosh PowerBook

G3 and PowerBook G4 computers (Apple Computer, Inc.).

See Appendix A, Abbreviation Chart for the list of abbreviations used in this

report. Please note that in Chapter 6 through Chapter 11, as well as the appendices, the

Awara examples are in semi-phonetic form. Specifically, aspiration, devoicing of voiced

stops, and vowel allophones are not shown. However, prenasalization is explicitly

indicated when it fills the coda of a preceding syllable.

Awara consonants have natural groupings of phonemes consisting of labial,

coronal and dorsal. These groups consist of voiced stops10 (/b/, /d/, and /g/), voiceless

stops (/p/, /t/, and /k/), nasals (/m/, /n/, and /˜/), and voiced spirants (/ı/, /l/, and /˝/).

10 Where the IPA uses the term ‘plosive’, the American tradition uses the term ‘stop’. They are not completely interchangeable. The term ‘stop’ used in the generic sense (without the modifiers voiced or voiceless) generally includes nasals whereas ‘plosive’ by definition excludes them.
14

Awara consonants also make a distinction between labial (/b/, /p/, /m/, and /ı/) and linguals (all others), in which labials behave differently than linguals in certain environments (as noted in the following sections). Awara also has labialized velar stops (/gw/, /kw/, and /˜w/).11
The tables in the immediately following sections list examples of each consonant phoneme in word-initial, word-final, and intervocalic positions. Consonant clusters will be discussed in section 2.1.8, Consonant Co-occurrence. Each table lists the phonemic form and the alternate phonetic forms for that phoneme. For clarity purposes, alternate forms are listed only for the phoneme in focus. The UFs in these tables are to a certain extent arbitrary. Certain aspects of the UFs will be justified later in Chapter 6, Noun Morphophonemics. The ‘-’ symbol is used to indicate affix boundaries in the UF and the ‘+’ symbol is used to indicate other boundaries in the UF, such as classifier, compound, and reduplication boundaries. 2.1.1 Voiced Stops
Awara has the three voiced stops /b/, /d/, and /g/, as shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8.
11 It is common among many of the Huon and Finisterre languages (McElhanon and Claasen 1970) to have either labio-velar or labialized velar stops, but not both. McElhanon and Claasen (1970) used the term labio-velar for both labio-velars (e.g. /gb/ and/kp/ ) and labialized velars (e.g. /kw/).

Voiced stops /b/, /d/, and /g/ occur word-initially and syllable-initially between

vowels, but not syllable-finally or word-finally. As in Nankina (Spaulding 1988) and

Tuma-Irumu (Webb 1992b), voiced stops are generally prenasalized by the homorganic

16

nasal.12 The prenasalization generally syllabifies word-initially, especially in slow speech or when the word is spoken in isolation. When the voiced stop follows an open syllable, the prenasalization always phonetically closes the preceding syllable.13 Voiced stops exhibit rare occurrences of voiceless unaspirated stop word-initially when prenasalization is deleted instead of being syllabified.14 Voiced stops also exhibit rare occurrences of voiceless unaspirated stop intervocalically after the prenasalization spreads to the preceding open syllable.15
Thus, the main contrast between voiced and voiceless stops word-initially is that voiceless stops are aspirated while voiced stops are not. The main contrast between voiced and voiceless stops intervocalically is that voiced stops always follow a homorganic nasal while voiceless stops do not. 2.1.2 Voiceless Stops
The phonemes /p/, /t/, and /k/ are mildly aspirated word-initially and syllableinitially between vowels, as shown in Tables 9, 10, and 11. They are unreleased syllablefinally. When they occur word-finally they are unreleased utterance-medially but are released utterance-finally or when the word is spoken in isolation.
12 Prenasalization is common in many languages of the Finisterre Range (McElhanon & Claasen 1970). However, voiced stops are generally not prenasalized intervocalically in borrowed words where the source language does not have prenasalization. See Section 10.2, Loan Words that Violate Awara Phonology. 13 See Section 3.2, Prenasalization and the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) for justification of this analysis. 14 Similar to Selepet voiced stops (McElhanon 1970c). 15 Voiceless unaspirated stops intervocalically is much more common in the southern dialect where /sadun/ is normally pronounced [santun] ‘axe’.

2.1.3 Nasals

Awara has the three nasals /m/, /n/, and /˜/. As in Irumu (Webb 1992b),

intervocalic nasals tend to be ambisyllabic (bleed to the preceding open syllable). This is

more common in slow speech and with words spoken in isolation.16 There are no

restrictions on the distribution of /m/ and /n/, as shown in tables 13 and 14.

All other occurrences of /˜/ word-initially are in borrowed Yabim names.17 (See Chapter

10, Loan Words).

2.1.4 Voiced Spirants /ı/, /l/, /˝/18

Awara has the voiced spirants /ı/, /l/, and /˝/. None of these voiced spirants

occur word-finally, and the phoneme /ı/ is the only one that occurs word-initially in

17 Yabim is a language spoken near Finschhafen which was used by the early church workers who first brought Christianity to the Awara community. When Awara people are baptized they are given a “Christian name”, often one from the Yabim language. 18 The term ‘spirant’ was used by McElhanon (1979), Gasaway (1997), and others to describe the natural class of /ı/, /l/, and /˝/ that contrasts with the stop series in many Papuan languages. Technically, of course, /l/ is not a fricative.
20

underlying forms. That is, the phones [l] and [˝] occur word-initially when word-initial

phonemes /t/ and k/ lenite, but otherwise do not occur as phonemes word-initially. All

three occur between vowels.19

The phoneme /ı/ is pronounced as [ı] with mild friction and as [w] with mild

rounding.20 /ı/ is also optionally pronounced as [v] after [i], as shown in Table 16.21

The symbol /ı/ was chosen to represent the phoneme (though [w] is also

common) for symmetry with /˝/ in the phonemic chart.

The alternation of [v] with [ı] and [w] in Awara provides further evidence

supporting Kenstowicz’s (1994) argument for grouping phonemes into labial, coronal,

and dorsal with [f] and [v] being categorized as labial, not coronal or a hybrid like

labiodental. He argues that [f] and [v] are labials, citing the fact that [f] typically

19 One interesting comparative note is that many Wantoat words that have sequences of two vowels (CVVC) have cognate forms in Awara where the vowels are separated by fricatives (CVCVC). It appears that the intervocalic consonant is more often /ı/ or /y/ and less commonly /l/ and /˝/. 20 This alternation appears to be idiolectal (e.g. speaker preference). 21 Spaulding(1988) reported a similar situation with alternation of the phones [p], [ı], and[w] among Nankina speakers.
21

alternates with [p].22 Similarly, in Awara, [v] alternating with [ı] and [w] would be

considered normal and acceptable.

It is also common for /pu/-initial words to be pronounced as [ıu] or [wu] by

many speakers (idiolectal). This alternation is limited to just the /p/ phoneme.

Table 17 lists some of the more common examples.

Table 17. Alternation [pu] ~ [ıu] /puya/ [phu.ya] [ıu.ya] [wu.ya] /puku -t/ [phu.khut] [ıu.khut] [wu.khut]

‘garden’ ‘I went down.’

Some words alternate between /ı/ and null between vowels (e.g. /suıat/ ‘Suwat

(place name)’ is pronounced as [su.ıat] or [su.at]). The null form generally occurs after

rounded vowels /u/ and /o/. However, not all words that have /ı/ after rounded vowels

intervocalically have the alternate null form.

The phoneme /l/ only occurs between vowels, as shown in Table 18.

22 One interesting side note is that Melanesian Pidgin English (commonly called Pidgin or Tok Pisin) also has a dialectic variation between [p] and [f] (e.g. [pai.a] ~ [fai.a] ‘fire’).
22

speaker preferences of [l] and [‰]. The phoneme /l/ does occur word-initially and word-

finally in borrowed words (see Chapter 10, Loan Words).

Like /l/, the phoneme /˝/ occurs intervocalically with varying degrees of mild

friction and does not occur in the word-initial or word-final position, as shown in Table

19.

Unlike /ı/ and /l/, the frication of /˝/ (and /k/ lenited) can be so mild that it is

phonetically unrealized. This tends to be more common with /k/ undergoing lenition in

verbs (e.g. /a-ku -ga -lÅk/ ‘PFocus- to go -s.DIpf -3s.Pres’ becomes [au˜galÅk] ‘Are you

going?’).

2.1.5 Unvoiced Fricatives

and the other is in a reduplicated form.23 All other occurrences of word-final /s/ are in

borrowed words. As such, /s/ will be analyzed as not occurring word-finally.

There is one occurrence of the phone [Ω] which is in the classifier suffix [-sim] ~

[-Ωim] ‘Specific’, as shown in Table 21. This suffix is contrasted to the suffix [-him] ~

[-sim] ’Diminutive’.

The Specific suffix is [-sim] after vowel-final classifiers and is [-Ωim] after

consonant-final classifiers. The phone [Ω] is analyzed as a phonetic realization of the

phoneme /s/. See Section 7.3, Irregular Classifier Morphophonemics, for a discussion of

[Ω].

not all words that have /y/ before /i/ intervocalically have the null form.

25

2.1.7 Complex Consonants (Labialization)

Labialization occurs with the velar stops /k/, /g/, and, in a few instances, /˜/. The

phoneme /kw/ occurs word-initially and syllable-initially but not word-finally, as shown

in Table 24.

‘cold’ ‘beg’
‘holy’ ‘locust’ ‘uninteresting’

There is phonological evidence that /kw/ is a single, complex phoneme. Like

other unvoiced stop stops, /kw/ lenites to [˝w] intervocalically at morpheme boundaries, as in the example /do- kwalamuk/ ‘not clean’ is [do.˝wa.la.muk].

Though lenition is applied to /kw/, there are no other occurrences of lenition taking place across other consonant clusters. This suggests that /kw/ is a single phoneme.

Also, there are no other occurrences of [˝w] apart from /kw/ leniting. The phoneme /gw/ occurs syllable-initially and word-initially, but not word-

finally, as shown in Table 25. Prenasalization of /gw/ is identical to that of the simple

voiced stop /g/.

The phoneme /˜w/ occurs word-initially in one onomatopoetic word,24 and it

occurs word-medially in a few other words. /˜w/ does not occur word-finally, as shown

in Table 26.

Since [˜w] is ambisyllabic intervocalically, there is no phonetic distinction

between monomorphemic [˜w] phones and those that occur from /˜ı/ at morpheme

boundaries, as shown in Table 27.

24 All cases of onomatopoetic words in Awara are reduplicated in which the base form is either one or two syllables. See Table 112, Reduplication with no Base Form in Section 8.1, Reduplication for other examples of onomatopoetic words.

There are many words that are pronounced with [k], [g], or [˜], and others that are pronounced with [kw], [gw], or [˜w]. However, as with Yopno (Reed 1993), there are

some words which can be pronounced with either, as shown in Table 28.

The velar is optionally labialized after the vowel /u/. The labialized alternate is

more common among villages other than Tawaya (the village dialect under

investigation).

Awara is not the only language in the Finisterre Stock that has labialized velars.

McElhanon & Claasen (1970) and McElhanon (1970a) reported that the Wantoat and

Uri language families as well as many other Huon Peninsula languages have these

phonemes. Davis (1969) and Webb (1992b) analyzed labialized velars as single

phonemes in the related languages Wantoat and Irumu.

2.1.8 Consonant Co-occurrence

Consonant co-occurrence is limited in scope in Awara. Since the maximal

syllable template for Awara is [CVC] (see Chapter 3, Syllable Structure), the only

sequences of consonants are across syllable boundaries. Many consonants have

phonotactic constraints preventing them from occurring in the coda position of the

syllable. The only consonants that can occur syllable-finally are nasals and voiceless

28

stops, as shown in Table 29. Phonemes that are not part of any consonant cluster have been omitted from the table.25 Table 29. Awara Consonant Sequences
p t k b d g m n ˜ y s h gw ˜w p_ - - x x x x x x - x x - x t_ x - x x x - - x - - x - - k_ - - - x x x x - x x x - x x m_ - - - x x x - x - x x x x n_ - - - x x - - - - x x - - ˜_ - - - - x x - x - x x x - - No reported cases. x Exists, see examples below.
The question then is: What consonants can follow nasals and voiceless stops? The main co-occurrence constraints are on geminates, spirants following any consonant,26 nasals following nasals, and voiceless stops following nasals.
It is also interesting to note that there are a number of sequences that only occur in loan words, as shown in Table 30. Some of these clusters, such as /bl/ and /sk/, occur syllable-initially because, unlike Awara, both Melanesian Pidgin and English have onset consonant clusters ([CCVC] syllables). Phonemes that are not part of any consonant cluster have been omitted from the table.
25 There were only two cases of phoneme /s/ occurring syllable-finally. These were questionable and have been excluded from this chart. See section 2.1.5, Unvoiced Fricatives regarding these examples. 26 Except as noted before with [˜ı] clusters at morpheme boundaries in which it is resyllabified as [˜w] (/pe˜ + ıÅha -k/ -> [pe.˜wÅ.hak] ‘It crawled.’)

In all Awara clusters of voiceless-voiced stops (including /gw/), the prenasalization of the voiced stop is either syllabified or deleted (e.g. /˜Åkge/ ‘much’ is [˜Åk.˜.ge] or [˜Åk.ge] ). Syllabification is more common in slow speech or when words are spoken in isolation. Deletion is more common in continuous or fast speech and utterance medially.
The following tables show the consonant clusters that occur in Awara. If there is only one example given of a particular cluster, it is because only one example was found in the data.
Table 31 lists the consonants that follow phoneme /p/ with example words. Voiced spirants cannot follow /p/.

The phoneme /˜/ is similar to /n/ in that the voiceless stops and voiced spirants do not

follow /˜/. There are no examples of monomorphemic words that have consonant

sequences that begin with /˜/.

The [˜n] sequence is questionable. It is unclear if the benefactive /-nimi/ is a

clitic or if it should have status as a full word. Awara speakers view the benefactive to

be bound to the preceding word. This is the only occurrence of a sequence of lingual

nasals. In all other instances of sequences of lingual nasals at the morpheme boundary,

the first nasal deletes.

The one occurrence of [sm] is in an apparent reduplication with the example

/musmus/ ‘louse’ pronounces as [mus.mus]. It is unclear if [musmus] is a native Awara

word since there are no other occurrences of /s/ occurring syllable-finally and [mus]

does not exist independently.

Generally, the lax vowels [ˆ], [´], and [U] occur before the sonorants [m] and [l]

and, to a lesser degree after [m] and [l]. They are more clearly pronounced as lax before

prenasalized voiced stops like /mb/ (e.g. /sibut/ ‘cake’ is pronounced as [sˆmbut] and

/sugum/ ‘sweet potato’ is pronounced as [sU˜gum]).

In the following discussion, the optional initial glottal stop is ignored in

examples with word-initial vowels.

2.2.1 Front Vowels

Awara has the two front vowel phonemes /i/ and /e/. Both phonemes have

allophonic tense and lax alternates.

The phoneme /i/ has allophones [i] and [ˆ], as shown in Table 38. There are no

restrictions on its distribution.

The [ˆ] allophone generally occurs before [l] and [m]. One argument that the

tense/lax distinction is not phonemic is from a syllable game which children play in

which two syllable words are reversed, as shown in Table 39.

2.2.2 Central Vowels

Awara’s central vowels /Å/ and /a/ are like Irumu central vowels (Webb 1992b)

in that the mid, unrounded vowel /Å/ is characteristically shorter in duration than the

other five vowels. Also, like Irumu, central vowels are fronted following /y/ and to a

lesser degree following alveolars. They are backed following /˝/ and to a lesser degree

following other velars.

2.2.4 Vowel Co-occurrence

Awara syllable structure allows vowel sequences at syllable boundaries (CV.V,

V.V, and CV.VC), but only in words with more than one morpheme. Awara vowel

sequences exist only in reduplication, when /y/ or /ı/ alternates with null

intervocalically, and in verbs with the prefixes /a-/ ‘predicate focus’, /do-/ ‘negative, or

38

/ma-/ ‘prohibitive’. Thus, Awara has a general constraint prohibiting vowel sequences

within morphemes.

It is not clear if [aa] sequences are two syllables, a long vowel, or if they

coalesce.27 This vowel sequence in words like /a- akop-but/ ‘P.Focus- come up -1s.Past’

can sound like a long single syllable [a:.kop.but] with the vowel length being about

twice as long as without the Predicate Focus marker or even as [a.kop.but] in fast

speech. In looking at one recorded instance of [a:.kop.but] in Figure 6, the long [a] has

two intensity peaks (see arrows).

27 Irumu (Webb 1992) and Selepet (McElhanon 1970b) have vowel coalesce with midcentral and mid-low vowels.
40

Figure 6. Spectrogram and Intensity Plot of Kwewu a-akopbut ‘I came yesterday.’ With careful listening one can hear the distinction suggesting that these long vowels are actually geminates (two vowels), not one long vowel, at least for this speaker in careful speech. 2.2.5 Diphthongs
There are no phonemic diphthongs. All phonetic diphthong candidates either have vowel sequences at a morpheme boundary in the UF such as verbs with the prefixes /a-/ ‘Predicate Focus’, /do-/ ‘Negative, or /ma-/ ‘Prohibitive’ (see Table 49), or as vowel sequences that have an intervocalic /y/ or /ı/ in the UF (see Table 47).
41

2.3 Summary of Phonemic Constraints 2.3.1 Consonants 1. Only voiceless stops (/p/, /t/, and /k/) and nasals (/m/, /n/, and /˜/) are permitted
syllable-finally and word-finally. All other phonemes are prohibited syllable-finally and word-finally. 2. Nasal /˜/ does not normally occur word-initially in native words. (Borrowed words have no such constraint.) 3. Lingual voiced spirant phonemes /l/ and /˝/ are prohibited word-initially in native words. (Borrowed words have no such constraint.) 4. The spirants /ı/, /l/, and /˝/ are never part of consonant sequences in either position. 2.3.2 Vowels 1. Vowel sequences are prohibited in monomorphemic words but are permitted across morpheme boundaries. 2. Generally lax allophones [ˆ], [´], and [U] occur before sonorants [m] and [l]. They are more clearly pronounced as lax before a prenasalized voiced stop like /mb/ (e.g. /sibut/ ‘cake’ is pronounced as [sˆmbut] and /sugum/ ‘sweet potato’ is pronounced as [sU˜gum]).
42

CHAPTER 3 SYLLABLE STRUCTURE Kager (1999) states ‘The syllable is a major ingredient of phonological generalizations’. The syllable plays an important part in Awara phonology. As discussed in Chapter 2, Phonemic Inventory, many phonemic constraints are phonotactic, based on syllable structure not on co-occurrence constraints. This chapter looks at the syllable in Awara phonology. 3.1 Syllable The Awara syllable template is [CVC], with the four syllable patterns: V, CVC, CV, and VC. As shown in Table 50, V syllables occur word-initially and word-medially across boundaries.28 There are no examples of word-final V syllables in polysyllabic words.
28 Awara distinguishes between various kinds of boundaries, such as morpheme, classifier, reduplicant, and compound.

Both VC and V syllables can have an epenthetic glottal stop word-initially. The

[¿] is non-contrastive word-initially (/ep/ can be said as [ep] or [¿ep]). However, there is

no indication of a glottal stop between the Predicate Focus marker and the verb root (see

Table 49).

3.1.1 Syllable Formalisms

Awara syllables are constructed by three syllable building rules, as described by

Kenstowicz (1994).

1. V Rule

VV N N' N''

45

2. CV Rule CV N N' N''
3. VC Rule VC N N'

These rules are crucially ordered as V (1) is before CV (2) which is before VC

(3) (Kenstowicz 1994) so that intervocalic consonants syllabify with the following

vowel. Table 54 shows an example derivation in Awara of CV (2) being crucially

ordered before VC (3).

3.2 Prenasalization and the Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) The Sonority Sequencing Principle (SSP) ‘…requires onsets to rise in sonority
towards the nucleus and codas to fall in sonority from the nucleus.’ (Kenstowicz 1994). Though the SSP is violable (not all languages of the world follow it), it is helpful in explaining why the prenasalization of voiced stops is syllabified with an adjacent open
46

syllable, tends to be de-emphasized or deleted word-initially, and is either deleted or

syllabified interconsonantally.

Consider the examples in Table 55. Nasals do not occur before the word-medial

voiced stops in the UF.

According to the SSP, nasalization of an oral stop in the onset is nonpreferred.

There are several ways to create a sequence that is preferred by the SSP. Example (1)

shows that when the voiced stop in the onset position follows an open syllable, the nasal

links to the previous syllable.

Deletion is more common in continuous speech and after nasal-final syllables.

Syllabification is more common in slow speech and single word utterances, for word-

initial voiced stops, and at word boundaries with the postpositional clitics.

Further support that these nasals are not separate phonemes in UFs but are

realizations of prenasalization is evidenced by a syllable game children play. The first

syllable of the word is moved to the end of the word and then the word is pronounced, as

shown in Table 56 under the column labeled ‘Reversed’.

The result is that the [m], [n], and [˜] in Table 56 are not present when the first

syllable is moved to the end. If they were separate phonemes in the UFs, then the second

syllable in the reversed forms would end in a nasal. Since they do not and there is no

prohibition on nasals occurring syllable-finally or word-finally (see Tables 13, 14, and

15), the preferred analysis is to treat them as realizations of prenasalization on voiced

stops.

3.3 Word Most Awara words are one to three syllables.29 Though words with four or more
syllables are rare, there is no prohibition against them. Reduplication and compounds are mostly four to five syllables. See Appendix C, Word Structure, for example tables containing lists of all the patterns observed in unaffixed words.
29 Nankina and Irumu unaffixed words also have up to 3 syllables. 49

STRESS

Awara stress, as in many Papuan languages (Foley 1986), is a pitch accent

system. Acoustic correlates to Awara stress generally are falling pitch and high intensity.

The following stress analysis uses metrical grid notation as presented by Kenstowicz

(1994).

4.1 Basic Stress

Awara has one main stress pattern with two alternate patterns. The main stress

pattern has stress on the first and third (alternating) syllables with primary stress falling

on the last stressed syllable, as shown in Table 57.

The stressable unit is the syllable. Each syllable receives a stress mark on Line 0.

All syllables are parsed into binary units called metrical feet starting from left to right

(Left to Right Parsing). Since parsing is exhaustive,30 the leftover (orphan) right syllable

in words with an odd number of syllables also forms a foot, albeit a degenerate foot. The

metrical foot is left-headed (trochaic) and projects a stress mark corresponding to the left

syllable on Line 1. Line 1 is unbounded (forms one upper foot) and is right-headed

(iambic). The upper right-headed foot projects a stress mark on Line 2 that indicates

primary stress. Line 1 is not conflated (removed), so the stress on the left remains as

secondary stress. Since stress can occur on both the first and the last syllables of a three-

syllable word, extrametricality31 is assumed to be off.

Stress is affected across word boundaries, as shown in Table 59. Primary stress

in these three-syllable words is not present before this one-syllable verb example.

30 The Exhaustivity Condition states that every stress-bearing unit must be included in some constituent except those which are licensed by extrametricality. 31 Extrametricality in the metrical grid licenses either the first or last syllable (but not both) to always be skipped in parsing line 0 stress into feet. Since stress in Awara can be on the first or last syllable, all syllables are parsed (extrametricality is off).

‘I see the sun.’

Stress deletion on these three-syllable words is accounted for in terms of metrical

grid parameter stress clash. Stress clash occurs when two adjacent stress marks on Line

0 are projected on Line 1. Awara resolves stress clash by deleting the left adjacent stress

mark, as shown in Table 60 with the example /gÅpmayi kÅ -t/ ‘hole see.3sO-1s.Pres’.

Each stress bearing unit (syllable) is assigned Line 0 stress, as before. Each word

is individually parsed into binary feet, left to right, and each left-headed foot projects a

stress mark to Line 1. However, stress clash now exists on Line 1. Stress clash removal

is applied from right to left on Line 1 and the left adjacent stress mark is deleted. The

right stress mark on Line 1 is then projected on Line 2.

Since stress is affected across word boundaries, this suggests that the

phonological word is broader in scope than the syntactic word. Further research is

required to determine the scope of which syntactic word boundary or phrase is affected

by stress clash (Subject + Verb, Subject + Direct Object, Adjective + Noun, etc).

52

4.2 Lexically Marked Stress

A second stress pattern is observed with some two- and three-syllable words in

which stress occurs on the second syllable, as shown in Table 61.

Gloss

[damé]

‘cliff’

[bu.tá.ya]

‘sorry’

[gu.tó.˜a]

‘crooked’

This pattern can be accounted for by at least two options. One option has these

words lexically marked for extrametricality on the left syllable. Thus, the first syllable is

ignored in the parsing of binary feet. This option claims that the first syllable of words

that are lexically marked for extrametricality are never stressed (grid construction is not

shown).

An alternative analysis has the second syllable being lexically marked for stress,

as shown in Table 62.

UF

[gu.tó.˜Å]

‘crooked’

Lexically marked syllables head left-headed metrical feet (e.g. Line 0 metrical

feet are built around lexically marked syllables before Left to Right parsing is applied).

Thus, lexically marked syllables always get Line 1 stress. Continuing the assumption

previously made that extrametricality is off.32 the first syllable forms a degenerate foot

32 See Section 4.1, Basic Stress. 53

which projects stress to Line 1. Stress clash removal is applied on Line 1 and the right

stress unit on Line 1 is projected on Line 2.

As shown in Table 63, when these words33 have one-syllable verbs after them,

the stress changes to the first syllable. However, stress does not change with these three-

syllable words followed by one-syllable verbs.

‘I see the cliff.’

/gutó˜Å kÅ -t/

[gu.tò.˜a ˝Át]

‘I see it’s crooked.’

If these two-syllable words were lexically marked for extrametricality rather than

lexical stress, then stress would never be applied to the first syllable. However, since

stress is applied to the first syllable of these words when they are followed by one-

syllable verbs, they cannot be lexically marked for extrametricality. Therefore this

hypothesis is dismissed.

The change in stress, as shown in Table 63, can be accounted for by lexical

stress. Stress clash removal deletes the left stress mark on two-syllable words that have

one-syllable verbs after them, as shown in Table 64.

33 Words that are either lexically marked for extrametricality or lexically marked for stress.

‘I see the cliff’

In this example (Table 64) as stated before, all syllables get Line 0 stress marks,

and lexically marked syllables head left-headed metrical feet. These metrical feet always

get Line 1 stress. The remaining syllables are parsed and Line 0 feet project stress to

Line 1. Here, all three-syllables project Line 1 stress and these Line 1 stress marks are in

a state of stress clash. By applying stress clash removal from right to left and deleting

the left adjacent stress mark, the correct surface form is derived.34

4.3 Stress Neutral Words

The third stress pattern is neutral stress, which only occurs with some two-

syllable words in isolation. On these words there is no dominant stress. About 22% of

the data analyzed for stress does not exhibit prominent stress in isolation.35 Some

examples of neutral stress are shown in Table 65.

34 If stress clash removal was applied from left to right and deleting the right stress mark, an incorrect surface form would result in the examples shown in Tables 60 and 62. 35 Stress neutral words also exist in Nankina (Spaulding 1988) and Irumu (Webb 1992).

When stress neutral words are part of a simple clause, the stress pattern changes.

Secondary stress is on the first syllable and primary stress is on the last syllable of the

utterance, as shown in Table 66.

Gloss ‘I see the bamboo leaf.’ ‘I see the mushroom.’

It is unclear why these two-syllable words do not have dominant stress in

isolation and yet have dominant stress in the derived environment of the phrase.

Preliminary acoustic analysis of pitch on these stress neutral words show that two-

syllable words with heavy syllables (CVC) have falling pitch on both heavy syllables.

This pattern is the same as the falling pitch pattern found on the stressed syllable in non-

controversial words. However, there are other stress neutral two-syllable words which

show no distinctive falling pitch on either syllable.

One hypothesis considered states that heavy syllables head metrical feet (receive

Line 1 stress) and stress clash removal is restricted from being applied to heavy

syllables. This hypothesis does account for some of the data.36 However, this hypothesis

also incorrectly predicts the stress pattern for non-controversial words, as shown in

Table 67.

36 About 50% of the words that do not have prominent stress. 56

INTONATION

Four basic intonation patterns have been observed in various types of Awara

sentences. The example sentences are written in the Awara orthography.

Pattern 1. Flat pitch with falling pitch on last word, as shown in Example 3.

3. Iwikge pekgaläk.

‘You are always sleeping.’

This is the most common pattern used in positive statements.37 This is also the most

common pattern for Irumu (Webb 1992b), Nahu (Minter 1998), and Nankina (Spaulding

1988).

Pattern 2. Flat pitch throughout and rising pitch on the last word or syllable, as

shown in Example 4.

4. Mataxu axopiläk?

‘Will you go to Matak?’

This pattern is common with yes-no, content, and rhetorical questions. It is also common

in Irumu (Webb 1992b), Nankina (Spaulding 1988), and Nahu (Minter 1998)

Pattern 3. Pitch rising throughout and falling on the last word, as shown in

Example 5.

37 For very long sentences, Awara intonation patterns like that of Nankina (Spaulding 1988), in that it tends to step downwards over the course of the clause. Spaulding classified this as a separate pattern but Webb did not. I have followed Webb in treating this as an example of pattern 1.
58

5. Using tahayo.

‘Do it like this.’

This is more common with commands, invitations, greetings, leave takings, and

negation.

Pattern 4. This type of intonation pattern occurs in shouted messages, as shown

in Example 6.

6. Mattias akopso!

‘Matthias, come!’

The pitch throughout the utterance is constant until the final word or syllable. The final

word or syllable is drawn out and has falling pitch. The entire message up to the final

word or syllable is spoken very rapidly and is staccato. This pattern has also been

observed in Irumu (Webb 1992b) and Nankina (Spaulding 1988).

CHAPTER 6 NOUN MORPHOPHONEMICS ‘…when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.’ (Doyle 1890) Awara morphophonemic processes are fairly complex. Though there are some morphemes that have only one form, there are many that exhibit multiple forms. These chapters on morphophonemics are organized according to the alternation sets found among the morphemes, and their underlying forms are presented in the discussion. It is assumed that all morphophonemic rules are generally applied (e.g. applied to both nouns and verbs) unless otherwise specified. 6.1 Noun Suffix Morphophonemics There are no cases of infixing in Awara. All morphophonemic alternations take place at morpheme breaks. Morphophonemic processes also take place at clitic boundaries.38 Awara clitics are one or two syllables. There are no three-syllable clitics. For this thesis, those morphemes (clitics and other affixes) that a native speaker cannot pronounce separately from the base morpheme will be treated as bound affixes and are included in this chapter. Reduplication and compounds are discussed separately in Chapter 8, Reduplication and Compounds.
38 Though clitics are quite well recognized, there is no clear consensus of how to define or analyze them. See Everett (1996) and Spencer and Zwicky (1998).
60

The Awara examples are in semi-phonetic form but will still be represented in

square brackets. Specifically, aspiration, devoicing of voiced stops morpheme-medially

and vowel allophones are not shown. However, prenasalization when it fills the coda of

a preceding open syllable, and all consonant variants as they result from the

morphophonemic processes being discussed, are explicitly written.

The isolation form of noun may end in a vowel, voiceless stop, or nasal based on

phonotactic constraints discussed in Chapter 2, Phonemic Inventory. Examples of

vowel-final nouns in isolation are shown in Table 68.

All vowel-final nouns behave identically morphophonemically. (See Table 244

the forms taking the alternate 3.Genitive suffix (see section 6.3, Irregular

Morphophonemics), nouns that end in vowels maintain a consistent form in all contexts.

Table 69 lists example nouns that end in a consonant.

all nouns that end in [p] in isolation pattern identically when suffixes are attached. The

six roots listed in Table 69, plus a root ending in a vowel in the isolation form, will be

used to show suffixal morphophonemics in the following paradigms.

6.1.1 The Dubitative (Non-Alternating Suffix)

As shown in Table 70, the Dubitative suffix is realized as [-bÅ].

Table 70. Noun [kek˜Å] [nap] [te˜at] [musuk] [mom] [sandun] [e˜a˜]

Dubitative [kek˜ÅmbÅ] [napbÅ] [te˜atbÅ] [musukbÅ] [mombÅ] [sandunbÅ] [e˜a˜bÅ]

Root-final voiceless stops and nasal segments do not delete before [-bÅ]. This is

the only non-alternating noun suffix in the language. Since there is no justification for

positing an abstract UF, the UF can be /-bÅ/ ‘Dubative’.

6.1.2 [n~˜] Alternation

As shown in Table 71, the 1s.Genitive suffix is realized as [-˜a] after dorsals and

[-na] in all other environments.

62

Table 71. Noun [kek˜Å] [nap] [te˜at] [musuk] [mom] [sandun] [e˜a˜]

1s.Genitive [kek˜Åna] [napna] [te˜atna] [musuk˜a] [momna] [sanduna] [e˜a˜a]

The expected geminate nasals in [sanduna] (*[sandunna]) and [e˜a˜a] (*[e˜a˜˜a]) simplify. However, the labial-lingual nasal cluster [mn] does not.39 Nor do

voiceless stops delete before nasals. From these examples it is unclear which nasal

deletes. Evidence will be presented later in connection with the ‘also’ suffix (Section

6.1.5, [˝~p~t~k] Alternation) that it is the first nasal that deletes here.

Two rules are needed to account for the alternations shown in Table 71: an

assimilation rule to account for the alternation between [n] and [˜], and a degemination

rule to account for the simplification of the geminate nasals. If the UF was /-˜a/, it

would be difficult to explain /˜/ becoming [y] after vowel-final nouns. Therefore the UF

for the 1s.Genitive can be /-na/ with /n/ becoming [˜] after dorsals. The assimilation rule

can be formalized as follows.40

(1) Dorsal Assimilation

C Æ [+dorsal] / C __

È -labial˘

[+dorsal]

ÎÍ -cont ˙˚

39 To confirm that the nasal consonant was deleted, I compared the duration of the nasal † utterance of each of these words using PRAAT (Boersma 2002). All nasals including
those arising from /n-n/ in UF, were about 70 ms (millisecond) but the [mn] sequence in /mom-na/ was about 140 ms (duration doubled). 40 See Appendix B, Morphophonemic Rules for a summary of all the morphophonemic rules and their ordering.
63

Dorsal Assimilation (1) states that non-labial stops (to exclude the dubitative

suffix) and nasals become dorsal after dorsal consonants. The rule as stated applies to

more than just nasals; this will prove helpful in discussions of the Ablative suffix

(Section 6.1.4, [X~d~g] Alternation).

The second rule needed is given in (2).

6.1.3 [y~n~˜] Alternation As shown in Table 74, the ‘after’ suffix is realized as [-nÅ] after labials and
coronals, [-˜Å] after dorsals, and [-yÅ] after vowels.

41 [a Feature] is short hand notation for the full specific feature set. 64

This alternation pattern is similar to that of the 1s.Genitive in Table 71. Dorsal

Assimilation (1) accounts for the [n]~[˜] alternation if it is assumed that /˜/ is derived

from /n/. Degemination (2) accounts for Lingual nasals [nn] and [˜˜] simplifying and for

the labial-lingual nasal cluster [mn] not simplifying.

There is no strong functional motivation for the nasal~[y] alternation, especially

given that [n] occurs after vowels and [y] occurs after consonants in monomorphemic

forms. It is problematic if the UF is assumed to be a nasal since suffixes like the

1s.Genitive (Table 71) which demonstrate the n~˜ alternations after consonants have [n],

not [y], after vowels. Thus, the UF is /-yÅ/ and /y/ becomes a nasal after consonants.

This alternation can be accounted for by the following rule.

(3) Nasalization

Since no other phonemes apart from /y/ have a nasal alternate form, Nasalization † (3) is restricted to just /y/. Nasalization (3) feeds Dorsal Assimilation (1), as shown in

6.1.4 [X~d~g] Alternation

As shown in Table 78, there are three suffixes which, like the nasal-initial

1s.Genitive, show an alternation between coronal and dorsal initial segments after

consonant-final nouns. The alternation these suffixes exhibit after vowel-final nouns will

be discussed after the alternation after consonants.

The initial segment in all three suffixes is coronal [d] after labials and coronals

and dorsal [g] after dorsals. This alternation is identical to that seen between [n] and [˜]

in the 1s.Genitive above. Dorsal Assimilation (1) was written so it applies to all coronal

stops (not just nasals), so no modifications to the rule are required to account for the

[d~g] alternation with the 2s.Genitive, Ablative, and Dative suffixes if [g] is derived

from [d].

Suffixes with this pattern have a variety of initial consonants after vowels, as

repeated in Table 79.

Their UFs and the processes that account for the allomorphs of each of the suffixes will

be discussed in turn: [-le] ‘Dative’, [-tÅ] ‘Ablative’, and [-ka] ‘2s.Genitive’.

The Dative is [-le] after vowels and [-de] ~ [-ge] after consonants (Table 79).

The two most likely UF candidates are /-de/ whose initial consonant softens (lenition)

after vowels or /-le/ whose initial consonant hardens (fortition) after consonants. Either

process is reasonably natural. Evidence will be presented later in connection with the 67

‘also’ suffix (Section 6.1.5, [˝~p~t~k] Alternation) that /-le/ is the UF and that the process is one of fortition as expressed in (4).42 (4) Fortition
C Æ [-cont] / C __
È +cons ˘ ÎÍ+voice˙˚ Fortition (4) states that voiced continuants (Awara’s spirants /ı/, /l/, and /˝/) † become [-continuant] ([b], [d], and [g]) following consonants. Fortition (4) is limited to segments having the features [+consonantal] to exclude [y] and [+voice] to exclude [s], both of which can occur after consonants at morpheme boundaries. Though fortition only applies to the Dative suffix /-le/ becoming [-de] after consonants up to now, it will be shown with the 23p.Immediate verb suffix (see Section 9.1.4, [X~b] Alternation), that it can also partically account for [˝~b] alternations exhibited with that suffix. Though Dorsal Assimilation (1) and Fortition (4) are not crucially ordered, Fortition is logically ordered before Dorsal Assimilation, as shown in Table 80 with the example /e˜a˜ -le/ ‘baby -Dative’. If Dorsal Assimilation is applied first, it makes a nonexistent velar lateral (represented by ‘˝’ in this chart) which has to be cleaned up by Fortition.
42 McElhanon (1973a) also considered the form after vowels (such as /l/) as the UF for Selepet phonology.

The Ablative suffix is [-tÅ] after vowels and [-dÅ] ~ [-gÅ] after consonants (Table

78). The most likely UF candidate is either /-tÅ/ whose initial consonant is voiced after

consonants, or /-dÅ/ whose initial consonant is devoiced after vowels. Evidence will be

presented later with the ‘also’ suffix (Section 6.1.5, [˝~p~t~k] Alternation) that the UF

is /-dÅ/. The following rule is needed to account for devoicing.

(5) Devoicing

C Æ [- voice] / V __
È-cont ˘ Í-son ˙ ÍÎ-labial˚˙

The feature [-labial] is needed because the /b/ in the ‘Dubitative’ suffix /-bÅ/ † does not devoice. It does apply to coronals and dorsals (e.g. the 2s.Genitive, which will

be discussed next). The feature [-continuant] excludes fricatives and [-sonorant]

excludes nasals.43 Devoicing (5) is not crucially ordered.

The 2s.Genitive is [-ka] after vowels and [-da] ~ [-ga] after consonants (Table

78).44 If the UF for the 2s.Genitive is /-ga/, Devoicing (5) will account for the correct

form after vowels. A rule for coronal assimilation is needed to account for [g] becoming

[d].

43 The feature [-nasal] would also exclude nasals, but [-sonorant] is more general. 44 Wantoat has a similar variation (Davis 1961a) such as with the Limitative which alternates as [kä~bän~gän], Subject Marker with [tä~gä~dä] and ‘dative or directional’ marker [de~ge].

The Feature [-labial] is used in order to exclude labials such as the Dubitative † suffix /-bÅ/. Coronal Assimilation (6) is not crucially ordered.

There are no other suffixes that pattern like the Dative.

Other suffixes that pattern identically to the Ablative are listed in Table 81.

6.1.5 [˝~p~t~k] Alternation As shown in Table 83, the suffix ‘also’ is realized as [-˝ÅyÅ] after vowels, [-
pÅyÅ] after labials, [-tÅyÅ] after coronals, and [-kÅyÅ] after dorsals.

45 Though the alternation between coronal and dorsal is a natural process in Awara, it is impossible to specify a single rule that defines a voiced consonant as coronal after labials and coronals and dorsal after dorsals. This is problematic for both Distinctive Feature theory and Feature Geometry.

The two most likely UF candidates for the ‘also’ suffix are /-˝ÅyÅ/ whose initial

consonant hardens (fortition) after consonants or /-kÅyÅ/ whose initial consonant softens

(lenition) after vowels. If it is /-˝ÅyÅ/ and the /˝/ hardens after consonants, there is

potential conflict with Fortition rule (4) which accounts for /l/ becoming [d] (a voiced

stop) after consonants. If both processes are cases of fortition, this would require two

fortition rules more restrictive in their scope—one resulting in a voiced stop [d] and the

other resulting in a voiceless stop [k]. Since having two very restrictive fortition rules is

undesirable, it seems better to posit /-kÅyÅ/ as the UF for ‘also’ and to apply a lenition

rule to account for /k/ becoming [˝] after vowel-final nouns.

Voiceless Stop Assimilation (9) states that a voiceless stop assimilates to the † point of articulation of the preceding consonant. Voiceless Stop Assimilation (9) must be

Stop Assimilation (9) cannot be combined with the other assimilation rules: Coronal

Assimilation (6) and Dorsal Assimilation (1). Also, since there are other voiceless

consonants (/h/ and /s/) that do not assimilate, Voiceless Stop Assimilation must be

restricted to [-continuant].

There is evidence of voiceless stop Lenition (7) occurring elsewhere, such as on † noun-final voiceless stops with the Negative suffix discussed next (Section 6.1.6, [ø~u]

Alternation) and with voiceless-stop initial classifiers (see Section 7.2.2, No Alternation

of Classifier-Initial Segment) supporting the original analysis. Also, lenition of voiceless

stops occurs at the reduplicant boundary and compound boundary (see Chapter 8,

Reduplication and Compounds).

Since there is independent justification for Lenition (7), and not for Fortition

(12), it follows that the UF for ‘also’ is /-kÅyÅ/. Devoicing (5) must applied instead of

Voicing (11) and /-ga/ is posited as the UF for ‘2s.Genitive’, since it would be

impossible otherwise to predict the correct surface forms of /-kÅyÅ/ ‘also’ becoming

[-˝ÅyÅ] and /-ka/ ‘2s.Genitive’ becoming [-ga] after vowel-final nouns. Also, Fortition

(4) must be applied instead of Lenition (10) and the UF for ‘Dative’ is /-le/, since it

75

would impossible to otherwise predict the correct surface forms of /-de/ ‘Dative’

becoming [-le] and /-dÅ/ ‘Ablative’ becoming [-tÅ] after vowels.

6.1.6 [ø~u] Alternation

The Negative suffix is realized as [-ndo] after vowels and [-undo] after

consonants, as shown in Table 92.

Table 92. Noun [kek˜Å] [nap] [te˜at] [musuk] [mom] [sandun] [e˜a˜]

Negative [-ndo] ~ [-undo] Gloss ‘bamboo’ ‘rope’ ‘nephew in-law’ ‘knife’ ‘aunt’ ‘axe’ ‘baby’

Negative [kek˜Åndo] [naıundo] [te˜alundo] [musu˝undo] [momundo] [sandunundo] [e˜a˜undo]

All root-final voiceless stops lenite (become voiced spirants) when followed by

this suffix. There are no changes to root-final nasals.

It would be difficult to account for the alternation between the vowel /u/ and null

in terms of insertion in light of the fact that vowels are not inserted before /-bÅ/

‘Dubitative’ (/mom -bÅ/ ‘aunt -Dubitative’ is [mombÅ] not *[momumbÅ]) or before /na/

‘1s.Genitive’ (/mom -na/ ‘aunt -1s.Genitive is [momna] not *[momuna]). In addition, the

same alternation is seen in the Topic marker /-u/ (among others), as shown in Table 93.

Topic [kek˜Å] [naıu] [te˜alu] [musu˝u] [momu] [sandunu] [e˜a˜u]

There is no justification for inserting a vowel in word-final position in these

forms. Therefore, it is best to posit that the vowel [u] as part of the suffix UF and /u/

deletes after vowels. The UF for the Negative suffix is then /-udo/.

The alternation between the voiceless stops and the voiced spirants of the final

segment of the noun root (/te˜at -udo/ ‘nephew in-law -Negative’ is [te˜alundo]) can be

accounted for by Lenition (7).

To account for the alternation between the initial vowel of a suffix and null, a

vowel deletion rule is applied.

Vowel Deletion (13) is not crucially ordered.

46 It is unclear if the Topic, Linker, and Conditional are one suffix with multiple roles or are homonyms. They all pattern identically morphophonemically.
77

6.1.7 [h~s] Alternation

As shown in Table 95, the 2p.Genitive is realized as [-hÅ] after vowels and [-sÅ]

after consonants. The root-final segment does not delete when followed by a voiceless

fricative.

2p.Genitive [kek˜ÅhÅ] [napsÅ] [te˜atsÅ] [musuksÅ] [momsÅ] [sandunsÅ] [e˜a˜sÅ]

The UF can be determined on the basis of other alternations, some of which have

not yet been discussed. The ‘after’ suffix /-yÅ/ (Section 6.1.3, [y~n~˜] Alternation) was

argued to have /y/ as the initial consonant of its UF. There is also the 2s.Imperative ([-

yo] ~ [-so] alternation) found in the verb suffixes. Since /y/ was chosen as the UF for the

[y~n~˜] alternations, then it follows that /s/ is the most logical choice for the [y~s]

alternation.47 This results in /-hÅ/ being the most logical UF for ‘2s.Genitive’.48

The following rule will account for the [-hÅ] ~ [-sÅ] alternation.

(14) H-Fortition

h Æ s / C __

H-Fortition (14) is not crucially ordered. †

47 To select /y/ for both ‘2s.Imp’ and ‘after’ suffixes complicates the rules in that /y/ becomes [s] after consonants with ‘2s.Imp’and [n] after consonants with ‘after’. 48 To select /s/ for both 2s.Imp’ and ‘2s.gen’ complicates the rules in that /s/ becomes [y] after vowels with ‘2s.imp’ and [h] after vowels with ‘2s.Gen’.
78

The only other suffix that patterns identically to the 2p.Genitive is the Diminutive /-him/.49 6.2 Noun Roots
Root-initial segments in nouns do not alternate.50 The only observed morphophonemic processes applying to the root-final segment in nouns are accounted for by the rules Deletion (8), Degemination (2), and Lenition (7). Since these rules account for the surface forms, there is no need to posit an abstract underlying form or a form which is different from the surface forms in isolation. 6.3 Irregular Morphophonemics 6.3.1 Alternate 3.Genitive Suffix [-i] ~ [-e] ~ [-Å]
The suffix /-nÅ/ ‘3.Genitive’ has the allomorphs [-i], [-e], and [-Å]. These occur more often with body-part nouns such as those shown in Table 96. However, it is unpredictable when to use the alternate forms.
49 Though the Diminutive has the same h~s variation, there are extra complications which are discussed later in Section 7.2.1, Classifier-Final Segment Morphophonemics. 50 There was one case in the recorded text data where a word-initial voiceless stop on a noun lenited after a vowel-final verb. However, further testing showed that lenition of initial-segment voiceless stops does not occur on nouns. The recorded text may have been a speaker preference or more likely a speech error.

When the alternative form is used, [-Å] is consistently used after nouns ending in

consonants, and [-i] and [-e] are used with nouns ending in vowels, replacing the final

vowel. However, the application of [-i] and [-e] is not predictable. All /i/-final nouns and

some /a/- and /Å/-final nouns use [-i], whereas other /a/- and [Å]-final nouns use [-e].

Since it is impossible to predict which nouns use the alternative 3.Genitive form,

and since the choice of the 3.Genitive allomorphs are not fully predictable, the

3.Genitive form of the nouns that use these alternative forms are posited in the lexicon.

6.3.2 Irregular Root Morphophonemics

When noun roots take the alternate 3.Genitive form, the root-final segment does

not follow normal lenition processes, as shown in Table 97.

The final segment /n/ on nouns becomes [l], and the final segment /p/ on nouns

becomes [y] before the alternate 3.Genitive suffix. There are no occurrences of final

segments /k/, /m/, or /˜/ on nouns taking the alternate 3.Genitive suffix in the data.

Lenition (7) accounts for the final /t/ becoming [l]. A minor rule needs to be posited to

account for /p/ becoming /y/ before this suffix (not formalized).

When this suffix follows vowel-final nouns (see Table 96), the noun-final vowel

deletes. Normally, the suffix-initial vowel deletes after vowel-final nouns (/sako -une/

‘choko leaf -Locative’ is [sakone]) or reduplicated vowels at morpheme boundaries

(/RED + uli/ is [uliuli], ‘nettles’) are not deleted. A minor deletion rule needs to be

posited to account for this deletion (not formalized).

An alternative analysis is to posit in the lexicon the 3.Genitive form of these

nouns that use the alternative 3.Genitive form since it cannot be predicted which nouns

use this form. Also, the alternate ‘3.Genitive’ form is not predictable after non-high

vowels and two minor rules must be applied to consonant-final nouns that use the

alternate 3.Genitive form.

A second irregularity in noun roots occurs when /m/-final nouns are bound to /t/-

initial classifiers. The /m/ becomes [p], as shown in Table 98.

CLASSIFIER MORPHOPHONEMICS

Awara classifiers are words that indicate the shape or arrangement of an object or

group of objects.51 For example, Awara has a generic noun /dÅki/ which can mean

‘wood’, ‘tree’, or ‘fire’. When a classifier is attached, it determines the meaning of the

noun, as shown in Table 99.52

Classifiers are left-bound to quantifier suffixes, as shown in Table 101.

51 See S. Quigley (2002a) for a syntactic description of Awara classifiers. Also, in the UF examples, ‘-’ is used to mark simple morpheme boundaries and ‘+’ is used to mark other types of boundaries such as classifier, reduplication and compound boundaries. 52 Though I have yet to justify the UF for classifiers, they are included in the following tables to help clarify the facts for the reader.

quantifier suffixes. However, classifiers can be concurrently right-bound to a noun

All noun suffixes except the suffix /-yÅ/ ‘after’ also attach to classifiers. The

alternation pattern for these noun suffixes following classifiers is the same pattern found

following nouns as previously described in Section 6.1, Noun Suffix Morphophonemics.

The suffix /-yÅ/ ‘after’ cannot be immediately attached to classifiers due to semantic, not

phonological, constraints.

7.1 Classifier Suffix Morphophonemics

There are suffixes that attach only to classifiers, as shown in Table 103. There

are no examples of classifiers whose initial or final segment is [p].

identically to /-yÅ/ ‘after’ (see Section 6.1.3, [y~n~˜] Alternation), where it is [-yat] after

vowels, [-nat] after labials and coronals, and [-˜at] after dorsals. The UF for

‘two.Definite’ is /-yat/. Dorsal Assimilation (1) accounts for the [n~˜] alternation, and

Nasalization (3) accounts for the [y~n] alternation.

The suffix ‘one’ patterns identically to /-dÅ/ ‘Ablative’ (see Section 6.1.4,

[X~d~g] Alternation), where it is [-tu] after vowels, [-du] after labials and coronals, and

[-gu] after dorsals. The UF for ‘one’ is /-du/. Dorsal Assimilation (1) accounts for the

[d~g] alternation, and Devoicing (5) accounts for the [t~d] alternation.

The Individuator patterns identically to /-udo/ ‘Negative’ (see Section 6.1.6,

[ø~u] Alternation), where it is [-nin] after vowels and [-unin] after consonants. The UF

for ‘Individuator’ is /-unin/ and Vowel Deletion (13) accounts for the [u~ø] alternation.

85

The Diminutive patterns identically to 2p.Genitive (see Section 6.1.7, [h~s]

Alternation), where it is [-him] after vowels and [-sim] after consonants. The UF for

‘Diminutive’ is /-him/ and H-Fortition (14) accounts for the [h~s] alternation.

There is one minor variation regarding the classifier-final segment with the

Diminutive suffix /-him/. If the classifier-final segment is coronal, it deletes before

[-sim]. This will be discussed next in Section 7.2, Classifier Morphophonemics.

The complete set of suffixes that attach only to the right side of classifiers is

given with their UFs in Table 104.

7.2 Classifier Morphophonemics 7.2.1 Classifier-Final Segment Morphophonemics
As shown in Table 103 with the Diminutive suffix, the labial and coronal classifier-final segments delete before [-sim] (e.g. /gwen -him/ ‘Cl.lump -Diminutive’ is [gwesim]). However, morpheme-final labial and coronal consonants do not delete on noun roots followed by an /s/-initial suffix (e.g. /sadun -hÅ/ ‘axe -2p.Gen’ is [sandunsÅ], as shown in Table 95). It is impossible to modify Deletion (8) or Degemination (2) to account for labial-final and coronal-final deletion with classifiers but not with nouns. Thus, an additional deletion rule is needed specifically for the final consonant of classifiers.

There is one dialectal variation in this rule. Some speakers delete just coronals

[hupkaıut], not *[hupaıut]. This can be accounted for by claiming that a classifier

boundary is different than a morpheme boundary.

The [k~˝] alternation can be accounted for by assuming that the UFs are /kaıut/

‘part’ and /kwÅbÅt/ ‘extended’, and extending Lenition (7) to be applied intervocalically

across classifier boundaries.

If the final segment of a word is a non-labial consonant, it deletes before

voiceless stop-initial classifiers. This has been previously accounted for with the

classifier /kaıut/ ‘Cl.part’ by extending Deletion (8) to classifier boundaries.

However, Deletion (8) does not apply to labial-final nouns that are bound to /t/-

initial classifiers (/nap + tÅk˜a/ ‘rope + Cl.rope’ is [naptÅk˜a]). Also, /m/-final nouns

become /p/-final before /t/-initial classifiers (/ıam + tÅk˜a/ ‘word + Cl.rope’ is

[ıaptÅk˜a]). A minor rule is posited to account for this alternation (not formalized).

As with /kaıut/ ‘Cl.part’, the UF for ‘Cl.rope’ can be /tÅk˜a/, and Lenition (7), as

modified above to extend to classifier boundaries, accounts for [lÅk˜a] after vowels.

To account for the [tÅk˜a] ~ [kÅk˜a] alternation, a classifier dorsal assimilation

rule is applied to classifier boundaries.

Since there are no classifiers that are /p/-initial to indicate otherwise, Classifier † Dorsal Assimilation (16) can be assumed to apply to all voiceless stops. Classifiers with

initial voiced stops such as /dÅkÅ/ (see Table 106) do not have a velar allomorph; this

justifies limiting Classifier Dorsal Assimilation to voiceless stops. 90

7.3 Irregular Classifier Morphophonemics

7.3.1 Specific Suffix

The Specific suffix is [-sim] after vowel-final and /n/-final classifiers and [-Ωim]

after velar-final and /t/-final classifiers, as shown in Table 110.

The Specific suffix is similar to the Diminutive suffix /-him/ in that both occur

only after classifiers and both have an allomorph [-sim] (which for the Diminutive suffix

occurs after all consonant final classifiers). Whereas non-velar consonants delete before

the Diminutive suffix, they do not delete before the Specific suffix.

There is some confusion regarding the Diminutive and the Specific suffix.

Though people understand the difference between [gwesim] ‘diminutive’ and [gwensim] 91

‘specific’, they do not distinctly conjugate most of the other classifiers with these two suffixes. Since they acknowledge that there is contrast between the two words [gwesim] and [gwensim], it is assumed that the two words have separate suffixes.
Over the course of working through the Specific suffix, my language consultant went from using [-sim] to [-Ωim] after all consonants.53 This was the only time we heard the phone [Ω] in Awara. [-Ωim] does not exist in any of the recorded texts and was never heard in normal conversation.
It is assumed that the UF is /-sim/ for the Specific suffix and a palatalization rule is applied. However, due to inconsistencies in the data, I have been unable to formalize the palatalization rule. It is unclear why Classifier Deletion (15) is applied to [gwesim] (/gwen -him/ ‘Cl.lump -Dim.’) but not to [gwensim] (/gwen -sim/ ‘Cl.lump -Specific’).
53 see Appendix D, Noun Morphology Paradigms, for a complete list. 92

REDUPLICATION AND COMPOUNDS

All base forms are one or two syllable words. The only case involving a three

syllable word is [matekmatek˜Å] ‘little things’ which has the derivational suffix /-˜Å/. It

is unclear if reduplication is limited to two syllables or if it is applied before the

derivational affix is attached. The result is the same.

There are two kinds of reduplication.54 In the first kind, the base form exists

independently. Words are reduplicated in full and the meaning is usually diminutive or

lowering in semantic category, as shown in Table 111 above. In classifiers, reduplication

usually indicates plurality.

In the second kind of reduplication, the base form does not exist independently,

as shown in Table 112.

Example 1 has the nasal /n/ deleting before the vowel /i/ at the reduplicant

that must be listed in the lexicon.

Example 2 has a lingual nasal deleting before a labial nasal at the reduplicant

boundary. This is the only example of nasal clusters across the reduplicant boundary.

Until there is more evidence for modifying a deletion rule to account for nasal deletion,

this word is listed in the lexicon as /mimi˜/ ‘aunt’.

It is unclear if the UF for Example 3 should be /RED + ipmÅ -k/ ‘RED + cut

8.2 Compounds

Awara compounding is fairly common and is not limited to fixed syntactic or

semantic categories. Compounds can be nouns, verbs, or classifiers.57 There are two

kinds of compounding. The first is where both roots are separate words, as shown in

Table 119.

57 When nouns are compounded to classifiers the distinction is blurred between the word being an actual compound or whether it is just the classifier being bound to the noun.

It is unclear if these are examples of slow speech (not deleted) rather than fast

speech (deleted). Further testing is required to clarify the facts. Either way, only in cases

of geminate clusters is deletion applied consistently in both slow and fast speech.

There are two compounds where the right word is /s/-initial, as shown in Table

8.3 Compounding with Possible Reduplication

There is one possible case of compounding occurring with reduplication with the

Option 1 involves reduplication with compounding and option 2 only

compounding. With regards to option 1, /natÅp/ ‘perceive’ exists independently, but no

other examples of /RED + det/ occur elsewhere. However, in support of option 2, both

/natÅpdet/ and /det/ occur independently. The preferred analysis for [natÅndetdet] is

therefore option 2.

CHAPTER 9 VERB MORPHOPHONEMICS Awara uses affixes on the verb to mark both subject and object agreement as well as aspect and modality. Verb prefixes mark object agreement which is discussed later in Section 9.6, Verb Prefix Morphophonemics. Awara’s subject agreement suffixes indicate a combination of tense, modality and subject agreement in person and number which are to a certain extent suppletive.58 For this thesis, they are analyzed as a single paradigm suffix as has been done for the nearby languages—Wantoat, Irumu, Nankina, and Nahu (see Table 268, Subject Agreement Summary Chart, in Appendix G, Verb Morphology Paradigms, for further discussion on this topic). The structure of the verb suffix morphology is shown in Table 129.
58 Suppletion of these suffixes is common in many Papuan languages including Wantoat (Davis 1964), Nankina (Spaulding 1988), Irumu (Webb 1992b), Umbu-Ungu (Head 1993) and Kewapi (Yarapea 1993).

Most of the combined subject agreement suffixes have alternate initial-segment

forms. These suffixes are called Set 1 suffixes. For example, the 3s.Past tense has the

forms [-kut] and [-but], and the 3s.Future tense has the forms [-pik], [-bik], and [-ıik].

The other verb suffixes which do not have alternate initial-segment forms are called Set

2 suffixes. An example is the 2s.Present tense which only has the form [-lÅk]. These are

shown with several verb roots in Table 130.

Morphologically based justification for positing two suffix sets is presented next

in Sections 9.1, Set 1 Verb Suffix Morphophonemics and 9.2, Set 2 Verb Suffix

Morphophonemics.59 All of the combined suffixes, except for the Present tense suffix set

and the 2s.Immediate suffix, pattern differently from the rest of the verbal suffixes in Set

59 These distinctions are most clearly observed with mÅ-final verb roots which are discussed next.
106

2. The only distinction between the two sets is that Set 1 suffixes combine subject

agreement with tense or mood whereas Set 2 does not. As a result, the combined subject

agreement suffixes (Set 1) exhibit alternate surface forms whereas the other suffixes do

not.60

Awara verb roots do not exist in isolation. Since it was impossible for my

language consultant to say a verb root without a subject agreement suffix attached, verb

roots and subject agreement suffixes are co-analyzed.

Verb roots pattern into four main groups based on the final part of the root. They

are [mÅ]-final, [Vowel]-final, [p]-final, and [t]-final.61 The main contrast is seen with the

2s.Immediate, 1d.Immediate, and 3s.Present forms, as shown in Table 132.

Table 132. Verb Groups

V-final ‘cut’

p-final ‘drink’

‘2s.Immediate’ [bupmÅ˜] [matÅ˜] [ta˜op] [halut] [butu˜] ~ [butut]

‘1d.Immediate’ [bupda] [matÅta] [ta˜opda] [halutda] [bututa] ~ [bututda]

‘3s.Present’ [bupmÅk] [matÅk] [ta˜ok] [haluk] [butuk]

The 1d.Immediate forms of the verb consistently end in [ta~da] and the

3s.Present forms of the verb consistently end in [k]. So it is assumed that [-ta]~[-da] is

‘1d.Immediate’ and /-k/ is 3s.Present. The verb ‘cut’ (V-final) is consistently [matÅ], so

/matÅ/ can be posited as the UF, and that means [-˜] is 2s.Immediate.

60 If the Present tense suffix set and the 2s.Immediate suffix are analyzed as the unmarked case, then they are not combined and are morphologically similar to the other suffixes in Set 2. 61 There is also a fifth group that have verbs that has both vowel-final and t-final surface forms.
107

All V-final verbs end in a vowel before the three suffixes. Most mÅ-final verbs have a short form ending in [p] before 1d.Immediate and a long form consisting of the short form + [mÅ] before 2s.Immediate and 3s.Present. The few mÅ-final verbs that do not end in [p] will be discussed in Section 9.4.1, mÅ-Final Verbs.62 All p-final verbs have allomorphs ending in [p] before 2s.Immediate (with no [˜]) and 1d.Immediate, and [V] before 3s.Present. All t-final verbs are like p-final verbs except that they have [t] instead of [p]. Finally, all V~t-final verbs have two alternate surface forms, one that patterns like V-final verbs and one that patterns like t-final verbs.63
It is assumed that the UF for mÅ-final verbs ends in /-p(mÅ)/, the UF for V-final verbs end in a vowel, the UF for p-final verbs ends in /p/, and the UF for t-final verbs ends in /t/. The alternation in mÅ-final roots is determined by the suffix—Set 1 suffixes take the short form, and Set 2 suffixes take the long form (see Table 131).
There are at least three options for analyzing V~t-final verbs. One option lists both alternate forms in the lexicon. A second option lists the V-final form in the lexicon and having these forms marked to have an optional minor insertion rule apply to insert a final [t] before all other morphophonemic rules are applied. A third option lists the tfinal form in the lexicon and having these forms marked to have an optional minor deletion rule apply to remove the final /t/ before all other morphophonemic rules are applied. Option one is not preferred since it posits two forms in the lexicon. For now,
62 Short forms of these verbs end in [p] or [m] with [p] being the more common. 63 This is very common in the Tawaya village dialect. However, it is unknown to what extend other villages do the same.
108

option three is assumed and justification will be presented later in Section 9.4.5, Dual V-

Final and t-Final Verbs.

All verbs pattern in one of these five verb groups. Each verb group has a minor

variant which will be discussed later in Section 9.4, Verb Roots.

9.1 Set 1 Verb Suffix Morphophonemics

9.1.1 [˜~ø] Alternation: 2s.Immediate Suffix

The Second Singular Immediate forms of verbs have the following final

segments: mÅ-final and V-final verbs end in [˜], p-final verbs end in [p], and t-final

verbs end in [t], as shown in Table 133.

Several analyses are possible to account for these verb forms ending in [˜], [p],

vowels (mÅ-final long form and V-final verbs), [-p] after p-final verbs and [-t] after t-

final verbs with geminate consonants deleting.

A second option is that 2s.Immediate is null. This assumes that mÅ-final verbs

are /mÅ˜/-finally, V-final verbs are /V˜/-final, p-final are /p/-final, and t-final are /t/-

final.

A third option assumes 2s.Immediate is /-˜/ and the phoneme /˜/ deletes after

consonants.

109

The first option does not give any significant insight and puts all allomorphs in

the lexicon. The second option requires an analysis of the alternation of [˜] and null at

the end of mÅ-final and V-final verbs. There are at least two ways of analyzing it. The

first assumes two lexical forms (/matÅ˜/ and /matÅ/ for ‘cut’). The /˜/-final form is used

when the root is word-finally, and the vowel-final form is used when the root is followed

by a suffix (see V-final examples in Table 132). This analysis is not preferred because it

posits two lexical forms. The second way assumes that V-final verbs and the long form

of mÅ-final verbs are /˜/-final and a verb specific nasal deletion rule is applied before all

other verb suffix morphophonemic processes. For Example, /matÅ˜ -da/ ‘cut -1d.Imm’

would require the final /˜/ to delete first to produce the form [matÅta] not *[matÅnda] (as

discussed next in Section 9.1.2, [t~d] Alternation). However, this is still less desirable

since nasals do not always delete. For example, the noun /sadun -dÅ/ ‘axe -Ablative’ / is

[sandundÅ] not *[sandutÅ] (see Table 78, Section 6.1.4, [X~d~g] Alternation).

The preferred option is the third where it is assumed that the UF for the

2s.Immediate is /-˜/ and the phoneme /˜/ deletes after consonants (as in /ta˜op -˜/ is

[ta˜op] ‘Drink it!’ and /halut -˜/ is [halut] ‘Wash it!’). This option supports the

assumptions made regarding V-final verbs and the long form of mÅ-final verbs as

vowel-final.

A deletion rule can be formulated to account for the nasal deleting after

consonants.

Nasal Deletion states that a nasal-final segment on a syllable deletes if it

immediately follows another consonant. Since [CN] clusters exist at morpheme

boundaries, Nasal Deletion (17) is limited to syllable boundaries. Nasal Deletion is not

crucially ordered.

There are no other verb suffixes that pattern like the 2s.Immediate suffix.

9.1.2 [t~d] Alternation

As shown in Table 134, the 1d.Immediate is realized as [-ta] after V-final verbs,

and [-da] after p-final verbs, t-final verbs, and the short form of mÅ-final verbs.

Since 1d.Immediate patterns like the Ablative suffix (6.1.4, [X~d~g]

Alternation), it can be assumed that its UF is /-da/ and that Devoicing (5) accounts for /-

da/ becoming [-ta] after vowels.

The 1d.Immediate does not have a [-ga] alternate. Since 1d.Immediate otherwise

patterns identically to the Ablative suffix and there is no indication that Dorsal

Assimilation (1) does not apply to verbs, this infers that there are no velar-final verb

roots.

Other verb suffixes that pattern like the 1d.Immediate are listed in Table 135.

23d.Immediate becoming [-son] after consonants.

Two verb specific rules need to be posited; one to account for labial assimilation

after mÅ-final and p-final verbs, and another for the final /t/ in t-final verbs deleting

before Devoicing (5) and Fortition (4) are applied.

Labial Assimilation (19) states that a dorsal consonant becomes labial after a † verb-final labial consonant at morpheme boundaries with Set 1 verb suffixes (S1). Labial

Assimilation must be restricted to dorsals since coronals do not assimilate (e.g. /ta˜op

-da/ ‘drink -1d.Immediate’ is [ta˜opda] ‘Let us drink!’ not *[ta˜opba]). Labial

Assimilation is in a mutual bleeding (bleeding and counterbleeding) relationship with

Coronal Assimilation (6), as shown in Table 140 with the example /ta˜op -gut/ ‘drink -

3s.Past’.

65 One supporting argument for the UF being /g/ initial is that in most Awara dialects, the allomorphs are [-kut] ~ [-gut], not [-but]. This dialect has an additional process to labialise verb suffix dorsals after labials.

Since there is justification for the UF of t-final verbs being /t/-final, a coronal

deletion rule for verbs must be applied to account for /t/ deleting before Fortition (4) is

applied in order to get the form [halukut] ‘He washed it.’ from /halut -gut/ ‘wash

-3s.Past’. However it is impossible to modify Coronal Deletion (18) so that coronals are

deleted before voiced labials, voiced dorsals, and voiceless coronals, but not voiced

coronals such as in [halutda] ‘Let us wash’ from /halut -da/ ‘wash-1d.Immediate’. Thus,

a second coronal deletion rule is posited as applying to just verbs.

As with the 3s.Past and 23p.Immediate suffixes, the final /t/ in t-final verbs

deletes before other morphophonemic processes apply, causing t-final verbs to act like

vowel-final verbs (V-final verbs).

To assume that the UF for the 2s.Imperative is /-so/ and a S-Lenition rule

generates [-yo] after vowels is problematic because of suffixes like /-hon/

‘23d.Imperative’. This is because the S-Lenition rule would also apply to these suffixes,

as shown in Table 146 with the examples /halut -hon/ ‘wash -23d.Imperative’ and /halut

-so/ ‘wash -2s.Imperative’.

H-Fortition (14) is applied before Coronal Deletion (18). S-Lenition would be

applied after Coronal Deletion so that /halut -so/ ‘wash -2s.Imperative’ would become

[haluyo]. Yet, the resulting derivation of /halut -hon/ ‘wash -23d.Imperative’ to

[haluson] would feed S-Lenition resulting in an incorrect surface form *[haluyon].

after vowels and voiceless stops after consonants. As with /-kÅyÅ/ ‘also’ (Section 6.1.5,

[˝~p~t~k] Alternation), the UF for the 3s.Future is /-pik/ which becomes [-ıik] after

vowels. Lenition (7) accounts for /p/ becoming /ı/ after vowels and Degemination rule

(2) or Deletion (8) accounts for [pp] simplifying. Coronal Deletion 2 (20) accounts for

the final /t/ in t-final verbs deleting before Lenition (7) is applied.

Coronal Deletion 2 (20) feeds Lenition (7), as shown in Table 151 with the

Summarizing, some V-final verbs that take the [p]-initial form are lexically

marked for not having Lenition (7) applied and some t-final verbs are lexically marked

to have a minor voicing rule applied to Set 1 [p]-initial suffixes. All other verbs roots

take the expected form; mÅ-final and p-final verbs take the [p]-initial form, and V-final

and t-final verbs take the [ı]-initial forms.

9.2 Set 2 Verb Suffix Morphophonemics

9.2.1 /n/-Initial Verb Suffixes (Set 1 or Set 2)

As shown in Table 154, the 23p.Imperative suffix [-no˜] has no alternate form. It

is [-no˜] after all verb roots. The final segment on p-final verbs and t-final verbs final

does not delete before these suffixes, and mÅ-final verbs use the short form.

Since [n]-initial verb suffixes have no alternate form and there is no justification

for supporting an abstract UF, the UF for the 23P.Imperative is /-no˜/. No further

121

modifications are required to the morphophonemic rules previously defined to account for /n/-initial verb suffixes.
There is evidence however to group /n/-initial suffixes with Set 1 suffixes rather than Set 2. MÅ-final verbs use the short form before these /n/-initial suffixes as with all other Set 1 suffixes, whereas it will be shown in the next section 9.2.2, Singular Dynamic Imperfective, and Section 9.2.3, Present Tense Subject Agreement Suffixes, that mÅ-final verbs use the long form with Set 2 suffixes. Final segments on p-final and t-final verbs delete before Set 2 verb suffixes (which will be shown next in sections 9.2.2, Singular Dynamic Imperfective, and 9.2.3, Present Tense Subject Agreement Suffixes), but not before /n/-initial suffixes. Finally, /n/-initial suffixes, including those listed in Table 157 below, are part of the combined subject agreement suffix paradigms which make up the Set 1 suffix group.68 Thus, even though they do not alternate, /n/initial suffixes do otherwise follow the pattern for Set 1 morphophonemic processes. Therefore /n/-initial suffixes are grouped with Set 1 verb suffixes, not with Set 2.
Other final verb subject agreement markers that begin with /n/ are listed in Table 155.

9.2.2 Singular Dynamic Imperfective

The Singular Dynamic Imperfective (s.DIpf) [-ga] does not exhibit alternations,

as shown in Table 156 with the subject agreement suffix /-k/ ‘3s.Present’.

MÅ-final verbs use the long form before the s.DIpf. The final consonant of t-final

verbs and most p-final verbs assimilates to [k]. There is however, a small group of p-

final verbs whose final consonant does not assimilate, but deletes before this suffix.69

Since there is no justification for positing an abstract UF, the UF for the s.DIpf is

/-ga/. Devoicing (5) does not apply to Set 2 verb suffixes (e.g. /matÅ -ga -k/ ‘cut -s.DIpf

-3s.Present’ is [matÅ˜gak] not *[matÅkak]). As with the /n/-initial suffixes shown above

69 The [˜] before the suffix /-ga/ ‘s.DIpf’ for these verbs can be accounted for by prenasalization.
123

in Table 154, root final /p/ and /t/ do not delete before [-ga]. Rather, they assimilate to

[k] before /--a/ by a dorsal assimilation rule.

(22) Root Dorsal Assimilation (restricted to verbs)

C Æ [+dorsal] / __ ][S2 g

Root Dorsal Assimilation (22) states that a consonant becomes dorsal before a † Set 2 verb suffix (S2) that is /g/-initial. It is limited to /g/ because it will be shown next

in section 9.2.3, Present Tense Subject Agreement Suffixes, that the final verb segments

/p/ and /t/ delete before /˝/, /h/, and /k/-initial Set 2 suffixes. Root Dorsal Assimilation is

in a mutual bleeding relationship with Coronal Assimilation (6), as shown in Table 157

with the example /halut -ga -k/ ‘wash -s.DIpf -3s.Present’.

As shown in Table 156, the final /p/ in most p-final verbs assimilates to [k]

before these /g/-initial suffixes. However, there are a few p-final verbs whose final /p/

deletes. This variant will be discussed in Section 9.4.3, p-Final Verbs.

The only other /g/-initial suffix that patterns like /-ga/ ‘s.DIpf’ is the Persistent

consonant of p-final and t-final verbs deletes.70 Since there is no justification for positing

abstract UFs, the UFs for these suffixes are the surface forms, as listed in Table 161.

70 The deletion rule will be formulized after further data is presented. 125

Accounting for verb-final segments /p/ and /t/ deleting before /t, k, h, m, l, ˝, y/

is problematic since this set of sequences is not a natural class. One option is to define a

brute force deletion rule (or rewritten as three separate natural rules). However, the real

issue is that verb final segments /p/ and /t/ delete before Set 2 verb suffixes. This is

morphological, not phonological. Since deletion is morphological, the preferred option is

to specify a morphologically conditioned deletion rule.

(23) Consonant Deletion (restricted to verbs)

C

Æ ø / __ Root ][S2

Consonant Deletion (23) states that verb root final consonants delete before Set 2 † verb suffixes (S2). Consonant Deletion is limited to [-dorsal] since the final segments of

t-final verbs and p-final verbs do not delete before /-ga/ ‘s.DIpf (e.g. /halut - ga -k/ ‘wash

-s.DIpf -3s.Pres’ is [halukgak]) as previously shown in Section 9.2.2, Singular Dynamic

Imperfective. 126

Consonant Deletion (23) is also in a bleeding relationship with the rules listed in

A cyclical rule order chain exists with Lenition (7) being ordered before

Consonant Deletion (23) which is ordered before H-Fortition (14) which is ordered

before Coronal Deletion 2 (20) which is ordered before Lenition (7). There is also

independent evidence with p-final verbs that Lenition does not apply to Set 2 verb

suffixes (e.g. /ta˜op -ke˜/ ‘drink -SS.Pr’ [ta˜oke]). Therefore Lenition is modified to not

apply to Set 2 verb suffix initial segments.

9.2.4 Modal Nouns

These suffixes behave identically to the other /n/-initial suffixes. Since there is

no justification for positing an abstract form, the UF is the surface forms /-na˜Ån/

‘Deontic’, /-na˜Åsa/ ‘Deontic’, and /-nage/ ‘purpose’.

9.3 Irregular Verb Suffix Morphophonemics

9.3.1 2s.Immediate Suffix With The Dynamic Imperfective

The 2s.Immediate suffix is /-˜/ and the phoneme /˜/ deletes after root-final

consonants (See Table 132). However, when 2s.Immediate occurs after the Singular

Dynamic Imperfective /-ga/ ‘s.DIpf’, it is null, as shown in Table 166. Also, the final

vowel /a/ in /-ga/ ‘s.DIpf’ is [Å].

71 Modal nouns are nouns that express concepts related to possibility and obligation that take non-finite clauses as their complements. They are clitics phonologically bound to non-finite verbs. (S. Quigley 2002b)
128

pahakakut

/paha/ ‘to do’ is a V-final verb

All of the other Immediate suffixes occur after the Dynamic Imperfective as

expected. It is unclear why /-ga/ ‘s.DIpf’ is [-gÅ] and the 2s.Immediate suffix /-˜/ is

missing on [paha˜gÅ] (/paha -ga -˜/ ‘to do -s.DIpf -2s.Immediate’). The alternative

analysis of 2s.Immediate as null (see Section 9.1.1, [˜~ø] Alternation: 2s.Immediate

Suffix), would account for [paha˜gÅ] not being [˜]-final (/paha -ga -ø/ ‘to do -s.DIpf

-2s.Immediate’). However, this alternative analysis does not account for why /-ga/

‘s.DIpf’ is pronounced as [-gÅ]. Therefore it is analyzed as suppletion (e.g. /-ga -˜/

‘-s.DIpf -2s.Imm’ is [-gÅ]).

9.3.2 23p.Immediate with the Dynamic Imperfective

The 23p.Immediate /-˝ut/ is normally [-˝ut] after V-final and t-final verbs and

[-but] after p-final verbs and the short form of mÅ-final verbs, as shown in Table 167.72

72 The 23p.Immediate and 23d.Immediate suffixes are the only two suffixes that exhibit the [˝] ~ [b] initial segment alternation pattern (see Section 9.1.4, [X~b] Alternation).

[natÅ˝akut]

The norm is for suffixes following /-˝a/ and /-ka/ to use the form which they

normally use after vowels. For example, /paha -da/ ‘do.p -1d.Imm’ is [pahata] and /paha

-ka -da/ ‘do.p -p.DIpf -1d.Imm’ is [pahakata]. It is unclear why /-˝ut/ 23p.Imm’ is

[k]-initial after these vowel-final suffixes but is [˝]-initial after vowel-final verb roots

(e.g. /matÅ -˝ut/ ‘cut -23p.Imm’ is [matÅ˝ut]).

9.3.3 Static Imperfective [-˝Åt]~[-˝a]

The Static Imperfective has two forms: [-˝Åt] and [-˝a]. [-˝Åt] is used before

coronal-initial Set 1 Suffixes and [-˝a] is used with all other suffixes.

Since the two forms of the SIpf are suppletive, the UF is both forms /-˝Åt/ and

/-˝a/: /-gÅt/ is marked for coronal-initial Set 1 suffixes and /-˝a/ is used elsewhere.

9.3.4 Same Subject -ke˜ and -hika˜

The Same Subject Perfective (SS.Pf) and Same Subject Durative Perfective

(SS.DurPf) markers have two forms. The first forms are [-ke] and [-hika], which occur

when they are not followed by other suffixes, as shown in Table 170.

by other suffixes, as shown in Table 171.

If these suffixes were always vowel-finally, the ‘after’ suffix /-yÅ/ following the

SS.Pf [-ke˜] should result in *[kukeya], the Dislocation suffix /-un/, *[kuken], and the

Conditional suffix /-u/, *[kuke]. Since they do not, the final segment [˜] of SS.Pf and

SS.DurPf deletes when not followed by other suffixes, is inserted when followed by

other suffixes, or SS.Pf and SS.DurPf have two lexical forms, one form used word-

medially and one form used word-finally. Insertion is not preferred since no other

vowel-final suffix requires nasal insertion. A deletion rule is also not preferred since it

must be limited to just these two suffixes since nasals exist word-finally elsewhere. The

preferred analysis is to have two lexical forms.

131

9.3.5 Benefactives

The morphophonemic processes between the final segment on verb roots and the

initial segment of the Benefactive are not fully consistent with those seen previously.

The long form of mÅ-final verbs, V-final verbs, and the p-final deleting subset73

are consistently [˜]-final before the Benefactive suffixes, and p-final and t-final verbs

are consistently [k]-final. The Benefactive surface forms do not exhibit alternations, as

listed in Table 173.

73 These are the same set of p-final verbs that pattern differently from regular p-final verbs in Section 9.2.2, Singular Dynamic Imperfective.

For now, it is assumed that the UFs for the Benefactive suffixes is the surface

form listed in Table 173.

It is unclear why mÅ-final, V-final, and some p-final verbs are [˜]-final and

p-final and t-final verbs are [k]-final before the Benefactive. The only occurrence of [˜n]

clusters in Awara are with the 1P.Benefactive affixed to mÅ-final, V-final, and the p-

final subset verbs.

9.4 Verb Roots

This section recapitulates the behavior of the four main groups of verbs; mÅ-

final, V-final, p-final, and t-final verbs. The following verb charts list one example verb

from the group under investigation and one example verb suffix from each of the

different verb suffix alternation sets. The left column lists the verb suffix alternation set.

The analysis of these verb groups is based on the collection of 117 verb

paradigms selected from 355 verb entries in the Awara data lexicon.

9.4.1 mÅ-Final Verbs

MÅ-final verb roots have a short form and a long form which contains the short

form plus /mÅ/74 ), as shown in Table 174.75 The short form is used before the combined

74 Spaulding (1988) reports that Nankina also has /-mÅ˜/ verbs but notes that it is unclear if the UF is /mÅ˜/ or /mÅ/. 75 The Southern dialect of Awara only has the long form.
133

subject agreement forms (Set 1), and the long form is used with non-alternating suffixes

(Set 2).

There is no phonological distinction of the short form of mÅ-final verbs from

other p-final verbs with Set 1 suffixes, and there is no phonological distinction between

the long form of mÅ-final verbs and V-final verbs with Set 2 suffixes.

Besides the short form of mÅ-final verbs ending in [p], there are some [m]-final

short forms, as shown in Table 175 with the example [tem] ‘write’.76

76 There are seven mÅ-final verbs that have [p]-final short forms, and two that have [m]-final short forms in the data.

These [m]-final short forms pattern identically to the other mÅ-final verbs.

It is nonpreferred to analyze [mÅ] on mÅ-final verbs as a morpheme on syntactic

grounds since no meaning is associated to it. However, it is also not preferred on

phonological grounds to posit two lexical forms for all the verbs that exhibit the [mÅ]

alternation;77 the short form used with Set 1 verb suffixes and the long form used with

Set 2 verb suffixes. Since mÅ-final verbs are a common verb group in Awara, [mÅ] is

posited as a formative with the UF /-mÅ/.78 The UF for mÅ-final verbs is the short form

(e.g. the UF for ‘sew’ is /bup/ and ‘the UF for ‘write’ is /tem/). Since there is no

phonological process to distinguish p-final verbs from the /p/ final short form of mÅ-

final verbs that take the /-mÅ/ suffix, all mÅ-final verbs are marked in the lexicon to take

the formative /-mÅ/ with Set 2 verb suffixes.

There is one verb that patterns similarly in that it has both a long and short form,

/ku˜Å/ ‘die’, as shown in Table 176. It differs in that the short form is [m]-final rather

than [p]-final and the long form is [˜Å]-final rather than [mÅ]-final.

77 As S. Quigley’s (2002a) analysis of [mÅ] does. 78 Formatives are suffixes with no apparent meaning attached.

With some V-final verbs, the /p/ in /p/-initial suffixes does not lenite, as shown

in Table 178.79 These V-final verbs otherwise pattern identically to V-final verbs shown

in Table 177.

79 There are 24 standard V-final verbs and 3 non-leniting V-final verbs in the data. 136

There is no phonological distinction for separating these non-leniting V-final

verbs that use the [p]-initial verb suffix form from the other V-final verbs. As previously

mentioned in Section 9.1.6, [p~b~ı] Alternation, V-final verbs which use [-pik] are

lexically marked for suspending Lenition (7).

9.4.3 p-Final Verbs

P-final verbs are exemplified in Table 179. These differ from mÅ-final verbs in

that the /-mÅ/ suffix is not applied to these roots.

Gloss ‘Let us drink it!’ ‘You drink it .’ ‘He drank it.’ ‘You drink it!’ ‘You drink it.’ ‘He will drink it.’ ‘you drink it.’ ‘You drink it!’ ‘He drank it.’ ‘He is drinking it.’

There are a few action verbs that are p-final verbs and have the final segment /p/

deleting before /-ga/ ‘s.DIpf’, as shown in Table 180.80 These deleting p-final verbs

otherwise pattern identically to the p-final verbs shown in Table 179.

80 There are five p-final verbs and four deleting p-final verbs in the database used for this study. However, there are many p-final examples in our lexicon which do not delete.

There is no phonological distinction separating these deleting p-final verbs from

the other p-final verbs (see Section 9.2.2, Singular Dynamic Imperfective). Since there

are only four verbs that exhibit this pattern, these deleting p-final verbs are marked in

the lexicon for Root Dorsal Assimilation (22) not applying.

There are some t-final verbs that have /p/-initial suffixes becoming voiced, as

shown in Table 182.81 These t-final verbs otherwise pattern identically to t-final verbs,

shown in Table 181.

the other t-final verbs. As previously mention in Section 9.1.6, [p~b~ı] Alternation,

81 There are 49 t-final and 10 voicing t-final forms in the data. 138

t-final verbs which use [-bik] are lexically marked to have a minor voicing rule applied

to account for /p/-initial consonants on Set 1 suffixes becoming [b] before other rules are

applied, specifically, before Lenition (7).

9.4.5 Dual V-Final and t-Final Verbs

There is a set of verb roots that have two optional surface forms. These verbs are

V-final and t-final, as shown in Table 183. These words can be said either way by the

same Awara speaker.

As it has been previously shown, deletion of the final /t/ in t-final verbs is

common in Awara verb morphophonemics. This is observed with Coronal Deletion (18)

(Section 9.1.3, [h~s] Alternation) and Coronal Deletion 2 (20) (Section 9.1.4, [X~b]

Alternation). Since there is no justification for listing the V-final form in the lexicon and

having these forms marked for an option minor [t] insertion rule, but there is a

precedence for applying an optional minor coronal deletion rule, the t-final form is

chosen as the UF for these verbs. These forms are marked in the lexicon to have an

optional minor deletion rule apply to delete the final /t/ before all other morphophonemic

rules are applied (not formalized).

139

9.4.6 Verb Root Lenition

Voiceless stop-initial segments /p, t, k/ on verb roots become /ı, l, ˝/ after vowel-

final words, as shown in Table 184.

9.5 Irregular Verb Roots † 9.5.1 Motion Verbs

There are two motion verbs ‘come’ and ‘come down’ that, like mÅ-final verbs,

have a long and short form, as shown in Table 185.

‘come down’ [epda] [epson] [epbut] [epbut] [epso] [epik] [epno˜] [ep] [epuk] [epu˜gak]

Like mÅ-final verbs, these verbs use the short forms [ap] and [ep] with Set 1

suffixes and the long forms [apu] and [epu] with Set 2 suffixes. Unlike mÅ-final verbs,

these verbs use the short form with the 2s.Immediate.

Since there are no other verbs that exhibit the [u] for the long form, the preferred

option is to posit in the lexicon the two forms /ap/ and /apu/ for ‘come’ and /ep/ and

/epu/ for ‘come down’.82 The short form is marked for Set 1 suffixes and the long form is

marked for Set 2 suffixes. The irregular 2s.Immediate form is also listed in the lexicon.

9.5.2 Verb ‘give’

The verb ‘give’ takes object prefixes. When it occurs with the Third Singular

Object Agreement prefix, the 2s.Imm form of ‘give’ is the expected form [imi˜], as

shown in Table 186.

82 Other options include positing /-u/ as a separate suffix (as was done with /-mÅ/) and applying minor rules to these two suffixes. Since [u] only exists on these two verbs, the preferred analysis is to posit them in the lexicon.

/na- mi/ '1s.O- give’ * [namihon] [namikut] [nami˝un] [namiyok] [namik] [namÅn] [namini˜] [nam] [namik] [nami˜gak]

However, when /mi/ ‘give’ occurs with the 1s.Object prefix /na-/,83 the

2s.Immediate form of ‘1s.O- give’ is [nam] ‘Give it to me!’. This is the only case of the

2s.Immediate form of a verb being [m]-final. The 2s.Imm form of /mi/ ‘give’ occurring

with the other object agreement prefixes is the expected [˜]-final form. The

2s.Immediate form of /mi/ ‘give’ with the 1s.Object prefix /na-/ is posited in the lexicon

as /nam/.

Furthermore, the final /i/ in ‘give’ deletes before /p/-initial suffixes, repeated in

Table 187.

It is unclear why these sequences reduce on this verb. No other /i/-final verbs

with /p/-initial suffixes reduce. These are also posited in the lexicon.

83 See Section 9.6.3, Person and Number Object Agreement Prefixes, for the discussion of the object prefixes.
142

9.6 Verb Prefix Morphophonemics

Verbs can have proclitics and object agreement prefixes before the verb root, as

shown in Table 188.84

Just as Awara enclitics were analyzed as suffixes for the purposes of

phonological analysis, Awara proclitics can be treated as prefixes.85

9.6.1 Predicate Focus, Negative, and Prohibitive Prefixes

Table 189 shows the Predicate Focus, Negative, and Prohibitive prefixes

attached to some Awara verbs. The column labeled “3s.Present /-k/” shows these verbs

as they occur without a prefix.

84 See S. Quigley (2002b) for further information. 85 See Chapter 6, Noun Morphophonemics.

‘Prohibitive’ [ma-]

There is a fourth prefix [ma-] ‘almost’ which is homonymous to [ma-]

‘Prohibitive’. However, not all people use this form. My consultant did not use this form

but used another adverbial construction. As such it is not included in the present study.

These prefixes are vowel-final. Root-initial voiceless stops lenite, and

prenasalization on voiced stops is realized as part of the preceding open syllable.

Lenition (7) accounts for voiceless stops leniting after these prefixes.

The UF for these prefixes can be the same as the surface form: /a-/ for Predicate

Focus, /do-/ for Negative, and /ma-/ for Prohibitive and ‘almost’.

9.6.2 Singular ~ Plural Object Prefix Distinction

Object agreement on the root falls into two separate categories. The first

distinguishes only between singular object [t-] and plural object [p-], as shown in Table

190 with the Prohibitive prefix /ma-/.

The forms with the Prohibitive prefix /ma-/ show that [p] and [t] lenite after

vowel-final prefixes; they also lenite after vowel-final words (not shown). The UF for

these are /p-/ ‘p.O’ and /t-/ ‘s.O’ and Lenition (7) accounts for these prefixes leniting.

There are several points to suggest that [t] and [p] could be analyzed as part of

the verb root rather than as separate morphemes. There is no evidence to support that

they attach to consonant-initial verbs (e.g. *[dopbumÅ˜] /do- p- bupmÅ -˜/ ‘Do not sew

them’). Rather, only vowel-initial transitive verb roots take /p/ or /t/. Yet, there are other

vowel-initial transitive verbs which do not take these prefixes. However, since the

evidence for analyzing [p] and [t] as part of the verb root is inconclusive, the preferred

option is to posit the prefixes /p-/ ‘p.O’ and /t-/ ‘s.O’ in the lexicon separately with one

lexical verb root entry rather than positing multiple /p/-initial and /t/-initial verb-root

pairs.

9.6.3 Person and Number Object Agreement Prefixes

The second type of object agreement prefixes attaches to a small class of verbs86

that require direct objects and are marked for both person and number as listed in Table

The verb ‘give’ is consistently [mi], the verb ‘to leave’ is [pma], the verb ‘cook’

is [hi] and [ha],87 and the verb ‘slice’ is [tÅ˜i]. The object prefixes can be analyzed either

as [n]-final or [V]-final, as listed in Table 192.

The first option for analysis claims that these prefixes are /n/-final and the verb

‘laugh’ is [imi]. Deletion (8) accounts for the nasal deleting before voiceless stops.

Deletion (8) would also need to be modified to account for /n/ deleting before /mi/ ‘give’

86 There are eight clear cases of these types of verbs in the data. 87 There is no phonological process that will account for the alternations [ha] and [hi] on the verb ‘cook’. Both forms are posited in the lexicon and are marked for which object agreement prefixes it can take.
146

and /ha/ ‘cook’. Since [nm] clusters do not exist in Awara, this is not problematic for [nm] on the verb ‘to give’. However, the UF /nh/ sequence on the verb ‘cook’ surfacing as [h] is problematic. Other UF /nh/ sequences surface as [ns] sequences (e.g. /sadun hÅ/ ‘axe -2p.Gen’ is [sandunsÅ], as shown in Section 6.1.7, [h~s] Alternation) or as [s] (e.g. /gwen -him/ ‘Cl.lump -Dim’ is [gwesim], as shown in Section 7.1, Classifier Suffix Morphophonemics).88
Option 2 claims that these object prefixes are vowel-final and the verb ‘laugh’ is [nimi]. This option is problematic with the verb [ta˜i] ‘slice’. This verb root does not lenite. Lenition has been shown to apply with other verb prefixes and voiceless stop initial verbs (see verb examples in Table 189). This option requires that the verb /tÅni/ ‘slice’ be marked in the lexicon as being an exception to Lenition (7).
Since neither option is ideal and there is no clear justification for preferring option 1 to option 2, option 2 is selected.
There are five verbs that are irregular in the use of the person and number object agreement prefixes, as shown in Table 193.
88 Also, as noted in Table 29, Awara Consonant Sequences in Section 2.1.8, Consonant Co-occurrence, there are [mh] and [˜h] sequences which suggest that there are no phonotactic constraints against [nh] sequences.

CHAPTER 10 LOAN WORDS The main source of loan words in Awara is Melanesian Pidgin English (Pidgin), although some come directly from English. Names and religious terms are often taken from Yabim.89 It is unclear to what extent words are borrowed from the related language Wantoat.90 Most of the words listed below have been gleaned from our corpus of texts (see Section 1.3, Methodology) and from works of literature translated into Awara. 10.1 Loan Words that Conform to Awara Phonology Word-final voiced stops in the source language become unreleased voiceless stops in Awara, as shown in Table 194.
89 Yabim and Kôte, historically, were the two Evangelical Lutheran Church languages used in the church until Melanesian Pidgin English replaced them. Awara people generally give their children Yabim names when the children are baptized. 90 Regarding Wantoat loan words, each Awara village has its own set of shared vocabulary with Wantoat which they regard as being Awara (this is expected since Awara is a related language to Wantoat). Where these shared sets of lexemes do not overlap from one Awara village to another, there are accusations between the two villages that the other village is speaking the Wantoat word. Villages on the western side of the Leron river and especially the northern villages on the western side tend to be the most vocal. This is a sociolinguistic issue dealing with language attitudes rather than an issue of what are considered loan words linguistically. As such it is left to a later date to determine which Wantoat words are actually “borrowed”.

10.2 Loan Words that Violate Awara Phonology

Word-medial voiced stops in the source language are not prenasalized in Awara,

Since voiced stops in the source languages are not prenasalized word-medially,

they are not perceived as voiced by Awara speakers, who therefore devoice them. These

however, are not the same as ordinary voiceless stops word-medially. Voiceless stops

normally have some aspiration, whereas these have none.

The most common phonotactic violation is with loan words that begin with [l] or

[r]. Awara does not have /l/-initial words. Table 197 contains some examples of

borrowed [l]-initial words.

10.3 Loan Words that Add to the Awara Phonemic Inventory There are several segments that are found only in loan words. The diphthong [ai]

occurs frequently in loan words, as shown in Table 199.

CHAPTER 11 ORTHOGRAPHY The following sections document an initial orthography and some issues that needed to be addressed in helping the Awara people to read and write their language. 11.1 Basic Orthographic Presentation and Spelling The orthography that has been adopted for Awara is based on the phonemic inventory, as shown in Table 202.

The normal spelling convention is for words to be spelled as they would be

pronounced in isolation. All affixes are written in their surface representation, not their

lexical form. For example: /ok -na/ ‘uncle -1s.Gen’ is [ok˜a] which is spelled as

<oknga>92 and /a- ku -ga -lÅk/ ‘PFocus- go -s.DIpf -3s.Pres’ is [a˝u˜galÅk] which is

spelled as <axunggaläk>.

The glottal stop, which is not considered a phoneme, is not written in the Awara

orthography. The two words that use it are underspecified (e.g. [hi¿i] is written as

<hii>).

92 Note that /˜/ is <ng>.

153

Where [ıu] is in free variation with [pu] word-initially, it is written as <pu>.

Where [ıu] is not in free variation with [pu] word-initially it is written as <wu>.

The loan diphthong [ai] is written as <ai> (e.g. [rais] ‘rice’ is written as <lais>).

Additional letters included to account for words borrowed from languages of

wider communication are listed in Table 203.

Example <fok> <Jems>

Gloss ‘fork’ ‘James’

The choice of letters has been dictated by the use of the Melanesian Pidgin

English alphabet and the English alphabet which are the dominant alphabets in use in

Papua New Guinea (PNG). Before PNG Independence (1975) it was more common to

represent the velar nasal /˜/ by the letter <˜> in many of the Huon-Finisterre languages

following the Yabim and Kôte orthographies. Wantoat also used the letter <˜>.

However, with Pidgin becoming more popular since PNG Independence and English

being taught in the elementary schools, most people now prefer <ng>.

11.2 Writing /Å/

Originally, /Å/ was underspecified by writing it and /a/ as <a>. However, there

were too many minimal pairs where context was not sufficient to distinguish between

them and this often lead to confusion, as shown in Table 204.

154

Gloss

/mi˜ -nÅ/

/inÅ/

Because this phoneme needed to be written as a separate letter, the umlaut <¨>

was chosen to combine with <a>. It was important to stay with <a> because people often

write both sounds with the letter <a>. As they become more aware of this phoneme they

are then able to add the umlaut to their writing without making additional corrections.

11.3 Writing Prenasalization

Originally, prenasalization was not written intervocalically except at morpheme

boundaries since it could be accounted for phonologically. However, problems

consistently arose at writers’ workshops with people who have been educated in Pidgin

or English.93 They preferred to write prenasalization intervocalically (e.g. preferring

<simbut> to <sibut>). To test people’s preferences about writing prenasalization, a word

list was created with 30 pairs of words (10-b vs. mb, 10-d vs. nd, and 10-g vs. ngg), as

shown in Table 205.

93 All education in the Awara area starts with Pidgin taught in one of several local kindergartens called Tokples Schools sponsored by the local communities. Children then advance to the national government sponsored community school located at Matak. See Quigley and Quigley (1999a) for a detailed discussion on the literacy rate and education system of the Awara people.

danggam dugum panggwat sagum sunggwak sunggum pigu wangga yaga bagwat

These words were randomly listed and given to the participants at a writers’

workshop, asking them to circle which words they felt were spelled correctly. Out of all

who were tested, everyone had a preference for prenasalization being written

intervocalically. People who had greater education showed a higher preference for

prenasalization to be written than those with less education. It was decided to write

prenasalization intervocalically. Since it will be the literate people who will encourage

or discourage the less literate people in learning to read Awara, it is important that they

feel comfortable with using what is produced.94

Another factor that supports writing prenasalization comes from borrowed words

that have word-medial voiced stops that are not prenasalized. Writing prenasalization

helps Awara readers distinguish the non-prenasalized voiced stops in borrowed words

such as [dabu˜] ‘holy’ written as <dabung> from the prenasalized voiced stops in Awara

words such as /sibut/ ‘cake’ written as <simbut>.

94 Via personal communication, most other SIL colleagues working in Morobe Province reported similar situations. in which they originally did not represent prenasalization. However, the literate community preferred writing prenasalization intervocalically, so they also switched to writing it.
156

Because of the support from the literate community for writing prenasalization

and the linguistic rational for representing it, it was decided to represent prenasalization

intervocalically, as shown in Table 206.

11.4 Writing <l> Versus <r>

Another issue with spelling occurred early on with the free variation between [‰]

and [l] intervocalically. Some people felt that some words should be spelled with <r>

and others spelled with <l>. To clarify this issue, a word list was created of 155 Awara

words that had [l] or [‰] occurring intervocalically. The two most vocal people were

asked which of these words should be spelled with <l> verses <r>. Table 207 lists the

total count of words for which each speaker clearly chose either <l> or <r>.

As shown in Table 207, Speaker 1 preferred spelling more Awara words with

<r> whereas Speaker 2 had a stronger preference for <l>.

Table 208 lists the comparison of their choices.

157

The first row states that there were 36 words (26%) that both agreed should be

spelled with <l>. The second row states that there were 29 words (20% ) that both

agreed should be spelled with <r>. The last two rows show that the speakers did not

agree on 54% of the words considered. Speaker 1 preferred <r> and Speaker 2 <l> on 59

words and Speaker 1 preferred <l> and Speaker 2 preferred <r> on 16 words.

After tabulating the results, it was obvious that there was no consensus between

the two men regarding the use of <l> and <r>. Over 50% of the time they disagreed on

which way an individual Awara word should be spelled. Since they agreed 26% of the

time on the use of <l> and only 20% on the use of <r>, they agreed (came to a

consensus) with us to use the letter <l> all the time for writing the [l] and [‰] sound.95

11.5 Writing Lenition

There was concern over the writing of voiceless stops that are lenited word-

initially due to a word-final vowel in the preceding word, as shown in Table 209.

Table 209. Representing Lenition

UF

PR

Orthographic

Gloss

/gusit-u tok˜Å/ [gusilu lok˜Å] <gusilu tokngä> or <gusilu lokngä> ‘the sun is hot’

In writing, people generally wrote words using the voiceless stop word-initially

regardless of the final segment in the preceding word. However, in reading, some people

95 Since that decision was made, there has been little to no resistance to spelling everything with <l>, including people attending writers’ workshops from neighboring villages.
158

commented that the initial voiceless stops of these words should be spelled in their

lenited form when they were lenited because of a preceding vowel.

To clarify which way word-initial lenition should be written, an informal test

containing two stories was devised, as shown in Figure 7.

Test Sheet A Story A
Lenited initial
Story B Stop initial

Test Sheet B Story A
Stop initial
Story B Lenited initial

Figure 7. Story Layout

Four people were each given one sheet containing two stories. They were asked

to read each story and make spelling corrections where they thought words were spelled

incorrectly. When two people took the test at the same time, one was given Sheet A and

the other Sheet B.

All of those tested consistently corrected those words which were written in the

lenited form to the voiceless stop form (e.g. <Wadotde xahit täpä xopbumäk.> was

corrected to <Wadotde kahit täpä kopbumäk.>). Because of this, it was decided not to

write the lenited form word-initially.

11.6 Writing [Ω]

[Ω] only occurs in the classifier suffix /-sim/ ‘Specific’ when it follows a

consonant. Because of the similarity in form and distribution of this suffix with the

classifier suffix /-him/ ‘diminutive’ which has the allomorph [-sim] following

consonants, most Awara people had difficulty distinguishing the two suffixes when

asked about them. In fact, because of a correspondence between /h/ in Awara and /s/ in

159

Wantoat, several people said that that the forms with [-sim] were Wantoat words. At this point /-sim/ ‘specific’ is always written with <s>. 11.7 Unresolved Issues
Further testing should be done with both the Prenasalization test and the Lenition test in other villages to determine if these preferences are the same for the entire language community. These tests were recently developed and due to time constraints only initial trial testing was made with people living at or visiting Guninggwan. The Lenition test also needs further work in quantifying the kinds of corrections people make.
Another orthographic issue still unresolved pertains to the writing of clitics. Should they be written separately or bound to the word they are phonetically attached to? Common practice in PNG has been to write monosyllabic clitics as joined and polysyllabic clitics as separate words. However, in the Huon Finisterre languages, this has not been the norm. Webb (1992a), Reed (2000), and others reported that all monosyllabic postpositional clitics, as well as many of the polysyllabic clitics, had to be written attached to the previous word. This was because people were not able to read them as separate words and people were confused by them not written as bound. For now it has been decided to write these clitics as part of the word. As people become more fluent in reading Awara, this decision will need to be reassessed with the potential of changing the spelling conventions.

Table 249 contains all known classifiers that occur with the Diminutive and the

Specific suffix.97

96 This paradigm needed the demonstrative /a-/ “this” to pronounce the individuating suffix. 97 It is unclear if all these classifiers can be conjugated with these suffixes. One of our language consultants said that some of these words conjugated with the Specific suffix are not real Awara words but just “play” words.

It is impossible to consistently separate tense or mood from person and number

for these suffixes. There are multiple forms for the combined person and number as well

as multiple forms for tense and mood. The choice of which forms to use does not appear

to be morphophonemically based. Since it is impossible to predict which tense or mood

form is used with which person and number form, they are analyzed as a single

combined suffix.

One day Yakutung and I went out by moonlight. We went up the Wantoat road. I went up and left Yakutung at the Mätän river, and I went up first at night. I went up and saw an animal at Kupähanggaman. I saw a cuscus, turned on the flashlight and put it on my head. I saw the animal, pulled the bow, shot the arrow, and missed. Then another one, and I shot another, then I shot another and then I shot another, and when I shot the last, I stepped on the bow and broke it and threw (the pieces) down below. I was there and Yakutung went up. Then we went up from there to Makdakane. We went up to find an animal, but we didn't find anything, so again from there we turned around and came down to home. That's all.
